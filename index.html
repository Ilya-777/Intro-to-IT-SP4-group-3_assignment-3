                          <p>I have been working for an oil and gas drilling services provider for the last 13 years in Australia, Brunei, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Thailand where I currently
                            reside with my wife and 6yr old daughter. Due to the oil industry being in decline since 2014, I have been engaged in tertiary studies to help facilitate a career transition to another
                            industry. I first completed a diploma of business at TAFE in 2018 and am now beginning my final year of a business degree in logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. </p>
                            <p>During my careerin the oil industry, I was exposed to IT in the form of PLC driven automated equipment and some networking troubleshooting. My hobbies include riding motorcycle’s around Thailand and
                              tinkering with various IT projects around the house. For example, I recently purchased an old Dell Optiplex PC and upgraded it into a cheap gaming desktop. I also recently made a wireless
                              print server with an old printer and a raspberry pi zero. Another project I am currently working on is an Arduino driven automated greenhouse which is tied to my current university studiest
                              and is also a personal interest. </p>
                                <a href="https://ilya-777.github.io/ePortfolio/">https://ilya-777.github.io/ePortfolio/</a>
                        <h3>Jayden Warrell: S3882576</h3>
                          <p>this is my first course to study through RMIT. To tell you more about myself, I grew and reside in Townsville Northern Queensland. I enjoy gym, athletics and
                            reading within my spare time. Before studying this course my highest achieved education was completing high school in 2014. After school I worked in various roles throughout mining and retail but am now
                            employed in hospitality.
                            <p>I believe my IT experience is at a basic level and limitted to basic hardware & software. Throughout my employment in mining, I have used ERP systems such as pronto and used the
                              programs to communicate safety procedures, stock levels and tasks throughout the company. I have seen directly how efficient information technology can be in a company. I personally believe it will
                              be much more utilized in the future as it develops which I find fascinating. I hope to increase my understanding and build applicable knowledge by participating with Average Joes in our group project. </p>

                      <h3>Sharif Ayazi: S3815095</h3>
                        <p> My name is Sharif Ayazi. I love playing with code and designing. I have finished my diploma and advanced diploma at Chisholm TAFE in Victoria three years ago.  I stopped studying for 2 years and now I am continuing again. I am a full-time employee working at a vehicle parts supply company. I have some experience of web design. We are using the Pinnacle system at the current company that I am one of their employees. The Pinnacle system is a powerful stock management system which can identify and display all the details of a car from mechanical parts to panels and print tags, scan, display inventoried parts lists on the company’s website, produce invoices and many other functions. I start studying IT again to achieve to my goal of furthering my IT career and make myself more familiar in programming. I have joined the Average Joes team towards the end of this assignment.</p>

                        <h3>Ben Vaka'uta: S3888875</h3>
                          <p>My wife and I moved to Melbourne from Auckland, NZ in March 2020, and Victoria shut down the borders shortly after that.  I have been in IT for 15yrs, started off from the IT Helpdesk, Desktop Support and now IT Infrastructure Engineer working fulltime.  During the 15yrs in IT I have done self-study for IT related certification to further my career development.  Some of the IT certification that I have completed include CompTIA A+, Network+, Microsoft MCP, Microsoft MCSE, and various Microsoft Servers certification from NT 4.0 to 2012R2.  In the last few years, I have found that my job is shifting a lot from being and IT Admin into a DevOps job which requires programming knowledge.  This include PowerShell, CLI and python, however I have resisted learning new programming language except for PowerShell because some of my daily tasks requires knowledge.  I am not proficient in PowerShell, but I know how to read the help syntax complete the task at hand.  I am taking this degree to have a formal qualification, learn about formal programming and cloud architecture.</p>

                          <h3>Jason Halse: S3882583</h3>
                            <p>I decided I wanted to change careers and so I am doing this course through RMIT. I am a chef by trade and because my circumstances changed i could no longer work in the hospitality industry, since then I have been working as a swimming pool technician, but this is just a job and not a career. I have always had an interest in I.T as I love building, repairing, and troubleshooting all types of technology from computers to kids toys I find myself repairing rather than throwing it away. My main passion has and always will be computers though I am just fascinated in how fast they have and probably will continue to evolve and what we as humans now rely on them to do for us. Although I have no formal experience in I.T I have always fixed and shown family and friends computer and taught them how to best optimise their software and hardware to achieve what they want to do with their systems. I build computers as a hobby and in my job, I am constantly repairing and programming chlorinators which in themselves are just mini computers. I am a very introvert person and hope that having to work within a group like The Average Joes this will help with me being nervous with working in a team.</p>

        <h1>Team profile</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="sectionContent">
        <h3>Ilya Anderson</h3>
          <p>Ilya is a neutral introvert / extrovert. His character is neither shy and reserved or overbearing. His balanced intuitive and observant style combines problem solving with past and future learning alongside hard observable facts. He exerts balanced decision making and emotional restraint.
            His positive attributes towards group work are his goals orientated motivation, and a dependable and positive outlook on group task attainment. He is also able to withstand difficult situations deliver successful outcomes.
            His negative attributes are that he is overly opinionated, dislikes criticism and is has difficulty encouraging and supporting team members when required for enhanced group cohesion. He can be inpatient, critical and aggressive, and dislikes long meetings, instead he prefers to dive straight into the task.
            His work style preference is that where personnel operate in a traditional and conventional, structured environment with a clear job role hierarchy. He prefers hands on work rather than analytical work and a work plan that is clearly set out towards goal attainment.
            To learn new concepts, he prefers to see them demonstrated in practice, experiment with new ideas to find solutions.  </p>

          <h3>Jayden Warrell</h3>
            <p>Jayden is more of an introvert and is more intuitive than observant meaning that he would rather discuss theories for decision making and problem solving.
              His positive attributes toward group work are his creativity, flexibility, and analysis. He also has a positive outlook with a healthy ego and is collaborative, open minded and imaginative.
              His negative attributes are that his contribution may be sometimes impractical, and he can also be absent minded and insensitive. This is where he must be mindful to remain well organized and demonstrate a strong sense of self discipline.
              His work style preferences are more flexible than structured work method. He also prefers non-traditional rather than conventional work structure. He would rather analyse problems rather than apply practical applications to gain the knowledge required to solve problems. He would rather not be in a leadership position but would prefer to be a key asset in the team.
              Jayden’s reserved nature with a tendency to be less directly talkative and reluctance to act are the key areas to be mindful of when in a team environment. However, his preference to be conscientious and helpful to others and goals driven are strong assets for team contribution.  </p>

              <h3>Ben Vaka'uta</h3>
                  <p>Ben is balanced extraverted / introverted. He prefers to gain insight from past experiences and places his agreeableness as a high level of importance. He is highly imaginative and often questioning the big picture and what if scenarios.
                    He is conscious of knowledge areas he wishes to expand upon to allow for greater team contribution and is prepared to develop those shortcomings to make himself a more valuable team member. This is evident in his IT course attainment to remedy any knowledge shortcomings. When in a team situation he prefers to surround himself with strong and knowledgeable individuals in area where he can develop the skill sets and experience through hands on learning.</p>

                <h3>Jason Halse</h3>
                  <p>Jason is more introverted than extroverted. He prefers to gain insight from past experiences and places the accuracy of his contributions as a high level of importance. He prefers to take a scientific approach to problem solving and would rather use his head than his feelings. He also prefers flexibility when dealing with problems rather than a structured approach. This allows him to react to situations rather than attempt to control them.
He also prefers to gain knowledge by a hands-on learning process. This is easier for him to retain knowledge through physical movement. His hand on learning preference means that he likes to tinker with projects to gain insight and develop solutions.  On the contrary, he finds it harder to retain knowledge and understanding when listening to something. He responds well to encouragement and uses this to reinforce his decisions that are 100% in line with the group’s objectives.
Jason’s quiet and reserved yet calculated working preference enables him to deliver valuable team contributions, however, he does not like asking for help and finds it very nerve racking when it comes to group meetings and discussions.
To be a key team member he should be speak up and open a clear dialogue of his ideas, contributions, and opinions of team workings. More hands-on experience in teams and positive reinforcement should see him more comfortable in the future.</p>

                  <h3>Sharif Ayazi</h3>
                    <p>according to structure above indicates that I am more extravert rather is more than Introvert. More comfortable in group work. Willing to solve issues. Willing to assist in a team. Consider work hard to be efficient in team. like to share idea. disinterested to criticism other. </p>

          <h1> Ideal Jobs</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="sectionContent">

          <h3>Ilya Anderson:  ERP Systems Implementation</h3>
            <p>My ideal area for employment is in ERP system implementation and integration such as SAP or Dynamics 365 Business Central system. This would involve sales demonstrations, solution designing and implementation, customer training and support. Ideally it would be in the logistics and supply chain industry.
              The required hard skills are a business degree, experience in ERP implementation, warehouse management, design and layout experience, as well as extensive Microsoft excel experience and basic SQL and CRM experience and customer support.
              The required soft skills are strong communication and problem-solving skills, analytical skills with attention to detail and business acumen skills, strong time and workload management.
              This job ties into my interest in business process optimisation and project management as well as my career experience and current business degree studies.</p>
              <p>My pathway to achieving this goal is to continue with my business degree studies and supplement with ERP training available online. Additionally, further studies crossing over into IT would also be beneficial in areas of cloud infrastructure and software development. At the completion of my business degree, I wish to be employed in the supply chain industry to gain real world experience with supply chain focused software applied to warehouse management and transport management and other business processes. After gaining an overview of warehouse operation, my next step would be to gain employment as a member of an ERP implementation team where my warehouse operations knowledge can be applied to the implementation of ERP software, facilitating changes in software where required and optimising business processes to align with software capability. </p>

              <h3>Jayden Warrell:  ICT Security architect</h3>
              <p>The future career I hope to pursue, is an ICT security architect. They specialise in protecting a company’s information from loss or leakage and ensure safety structures are effective. They are generally responsible for testing, designing, and implementing security infrastructure within a system. They more specifically achieve this by maintaining or installing security software, performing, regulating access of employees to the system based on roles, reviewing systems with ethical hacking or penetration testing, responding to data breaches, and implementing improvements or procedures.</p>
              <p>This role is continuously challenging and desirable to me since it carries such high significance. The reason being how cyber-attacks are growing threats to any industry which relies on technology to store prized information. These attacks are usually intended to manipulate a company or sell any valuable data for financial gain. The outcome could devastate an organisation, essentially resulting in espionage. </p>
              <p>Entering this position would certainly require hard skills such as an IT associated bachelor’s degree, experience with security controls such as firewalls, knowledge of windows server, and an understanding of UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Furthermore, the ideal soft skills involve problem solving, planning, troubleshooting, strong communication and critical thinking. I express a strong passion to one day achieve this title and a realistic approach will be to complete my bachelor’s degree. In addition, I will need to complete further courses based on security architecture to hone my skills more relevant. This may precisely refer to CEH, CISSP-ISSAP or CSSA to name a few. Lastly, it would be beneficial to proceed to work in an entry level IT position to gain field experience in applying my certified knowledge.</p>

              <h3>Ben Vaka'uta: IT Solution or Infrastructure Architect</h3>
              <p>I would like to move to an IT Solution Architect or IT Infrastructure Architect. However, I am seeing a lot of companies' IT Infrastructure moving to the cloud as IaaS and PaaS which means that some organization might not need an inhouse Solution Architect or IT Infrastructure Architect. If this trend is where IT is heading, then I will upskill to an Azure cloud IT engineer. The days of standing up a new server and configuring an exchange server for your business are numbered, thanks to Microsoft Exchange Online.</p>

              <h3>Jason Halse: ICT Support Technician </h3>
              <p>My ideal job would be an ICT support technician. They provide support for and maintenance for the computer related infrastructure. This would involve helping people setup and troubleshoot/repair every day I.T equipment and software needed to carry out their jobs. To succeed in this position, I would need a broad knowledge of computer hardware including P.C, laptops, tablets, and smart phones. I would also need a broad knowledge of the common software that is used in the environment, some of which might include windows, office 365, outlook. </p>
              <p>Although no formal qualifications are needed for this role whenever I see a job advertised, they generally ask for a diploma or bachelor’s degree in I.T I believe this course will give me the broad knowledge required to help me succeed in this role.
              Some of the skills I already possess that I think will also help are trouble shooting, customer relationships, being able to explain technical problems to non-technical people, being approachable, and being able to see problems that may otherwise be overlooked. In the current job I have I am often repairing computerised pool equipment and believe this would also be beneficial in some capacity.  </p>

              <h3>Sharif Ayaz: IT Support </h3>
              <p>My idea job is the position of IT support in the automotive Industry. The details of this position include support for current IT related resources such as desktop computers, networking equipment, printers and related software as well as providing technical recommendations to management. Additionally, the IT support position would also include development and maintenance of company websites such as adding new posts, updates, and data entry into systems.
                The hard skills that would be required for this position includes SQL, Microsoft windows, Microsoft Office, Technical support, website production, and knowledge of ERP systems such as Pinnacle, SAP and Oracle.
                The soft skills required include communication, problem solving, teamwork, trouble shooting, analytical skills and being a self-starter.
                A substantial portion of the skills can be learned on the job; however, a university degree is a solid platform to begin with.</p>

                  <p>Table 1. Group members skill set requirements.</P>

              <h3>Summary and analysis of the group's ideal jobs' required skillsets</h3>
                <p>An analysis of the groups required skill sets for their ideal jobs shows a wide spread of individual career preferences in IT. It also highlights that there is a shared common base of ground level skill for most IT jobs. Most IT related jobs typically require a university degree where the student learns not only some of the required hard skills but also some valuable soft skills such as communication, problem solving, time management and planning.</P>
                  <p>Where the required skills differ is the degree of specialised knowledge that is required for their ideal job, this could be due to the rapid change and development of new areas in IT.  Some of these specialised skills can be developed at through a structured course at university and other required skills can be developed informally using a wide range of resources available online which can be accomplished in the student’s free time prior to seeking employment, or when looking to advance an IT career. </P>
                    <p>It is also thought that with the attainment of these commonly shared base skills and through upskilling a small set of specialised skills, it may be possible to cross over into other areas of IT relatively easily.  </P>

            <h3>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
              <p>Ilya – ERP implementation lead, Logistics and Supply Chain. Employer demand for this job is High with approximately 13,111 positions reported between 2017 - 2018. </p>
              <p>Ben - IT Solution Architect and IT Infrastructure Architect. Employer demand for this job is high with approximately 13,111 positions reported between 2017 – 2018. </p>
              <p>Jayden – Security Architecture. Employer demand for this job is medium with approximately 2914 positions reported between 2017 – 2018.</p>

              <p>Sharif - ICT Support Technician. Employer demand for this job is medium with approximately 3246 positions reported between 2017 – 2018.</p>

              <h3>From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).  </h3>

                <p>The groups required general skills are communication, problem solving, analytical, attention to detail and business acumen, time and workload management, customer service orientated, hand on approach, mentoring, planning, critical thinking.
                  The groups required IT specific skills are SQL experience, advanced Microsoft Excel, proficiency in Microsoft office suite, knowledge of Microsoft windows, Unix and Linux platforms, ERP Warehouse management software experience, Cybersecurity, Infrastructure implementation and support.</p>

                  <h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h3>

                  <p>SQL is a required skill set for most of the group members and is the top ranked IT skill in the burning glass data. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Unix systems knowledge is closely ranked below and is followed by business analysis, technical support, customer service and Microsoft office products. IT infrastructure experience is a vital skillset as is server OS deployment, support and troubleshooting, various systems implementation and Microsoft system administration skillsets.  </p>

                  <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?  </h3>
                    <p>Communication, problem solving, and organisational skills are the required skill sets from the groups ideal jobs and are the top three greatest demanded skills. This is closely followed by teamwork, planning and collaboration skills. Time management, analytical, and self-starter skills are also highly demanded skills.   </p>

                    <h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?  </h3>
                      <p>Java script, JAVA, and graphic design are mostly not in the groups required skill sets, however as knowledge of the positions in the IT industry increase these requirements may change.</p>

                      <h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?  </h3>
                        <p>Ilya: Creativity, research and mentoring are not in my required skill set when basing my decision on the job advertisement information, however I would imagine that all of the baseline skills are important to some degree and therefore a requirement for career development.</p>
                        <p>Ben: SQL and JavaScript. I have no appetite to study SQL; however, I will study Java next semester as it’s a requirement for my degree. </p>
                        <p>Jason: SQL Javascript and Java are not in my required skill sets. </p>
                        <p>Jayden: SQL, Java and Java script are not within my required skill set although SQL may be a system relevant to distribute security architecture across. Java and java scripting are less applicable to the position.</p>

                        <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?  </h3>
                          <p>Ilya: Having studied ERP implementation at RMIT last semester, I had knowledge of skill requirements, however the burning glass data provided more refined and up to date information. I can also see that my university studies develop both soft and hard skills that are requirements in my ideal job. My pathway to this career now includes learning more about SQL as I did not realise this was such a demanded skill for data analysis which is particularly useful in warehouse inventory management. Outside of my ideal job, my hobby projects include learning C++ in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment is also a useful skill that is in high demand.</p>
                          <p>Ben: I am staying with my current ideal job because its ranked number one in Top titles.</p>
                          <p>Jayden: My opinion and insights of my ideal job have changed considerably after studying the burning glass data. It has provoked further research into the title itself. This gave me a more accurate understanding regarding details of the required skills and specific tasks entailed. I have further noticed the job is not limited to a small portion of the network to provide security across. The variations of IT- related skills can vary among many platforms specific to a company’s needs which could change among clients. I now highly regard learning Linux, Unix and Microsoft server platforms so I can understand how fundamental principles work within across all these systems. In the hope learning these hard skills will provide me a framework and help me adjust easier to learning new operating systems on demand. I also now realize how valuable troubleshooting can be as a generic skill.</p>
                          <p>Jason: No, my opinion has not changed. I like how broad the job could be. I like learning and teaching and believe that my ideal job would be a great platform for that.</p>

            <h1>IT work: Questions answered by an industry professional</h1>
            </div>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <h3>What is your job title and what does your job involve?</h3>
              <p>Senior .NET Developer. My job encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and analysis, development and testing, security and performance tuning through to final deployment of projects. I primarily develop in .NET using the C# language. </p>

              <h3>What industry do you work in and what are some of the things your job does for that industry? </h3>
                <p>I work in the logistics industry, specifically for a freight forwarder / 3PL, responsible for importing / exporting and warehousing goods.
                  The focus of almost all the projects we implement is to deliver value to our clients. This can be in the form of providing a web application for the client or our internal staff to manage operational duties more efficiently. Providing integration between the many facets of the logistics industry, such as Australian Customs, International freight forwarders, local postage services and transport companies. Automating manual tasks. Designing reports / dashboards to provide data analysis and identify trends and issues in the data of the company and clients. Building on top of the widely used logistics ERP software CargoWise 1, to provide a competitive edge to the company.</p>

                  <h3>Who are some of the people you deal with on a day-to-day basis and what role do they play in your job?</h3>
                  <ul class="keySkills">
<li>Business users (company staff): Providing requirements for new projects, reporting bugs, providing feedback on completed work.</li>
<li>Management: Providing high level direction on what to work on, reporting on workload and completed projects.</li>
<li>Development team: Assigning tasks, helping with issues, providing feedback.</li>
<li>Clients: Discussing current tasks, answering questions.</li>
<li>Third parties: Implementing, testing or reporting issues around integration. </li>
</ul>

                <h3>What some of your responsibilities in the role that you work in? </h3>
                <p>Due to the size of the company and team I work in, my role encompasses many duties that are generally split into separate roles as the development team grows larger. Some of these duties include: </p>
                <ul class="keySkills">
                <li>Requirements gathering, requirements analysis, and scoping new projects. </li>
                <li>Developing new software and maintaining existing software. </li>
                <li>Testing completed projects with clients / third parties.</li>
                <li>Managing a small team to perform the above duties. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>What are the main types of software that you use daily? </h3>
                    <p>As we are a Microsoft developer house, the tech Stack in use is primarily: C#, ASP.NET, SQL, Entity Framework. The main software I use daily:
                      Visual Studio (.NET Development), SQL Server Management Studio (SQL Development) Postman (Web API Development), Azure DevOps (Task management / Source Control), Service Desk Plus (Helpdesk tickets), Outlook (Email) </p>

                    <h3>Is there such thing as a “typical day” in your role?  </h3>
                      <p>A typical day would most likely be: 70% Project work, 20% Maintenance, 10% Communication. Every day is different, some days can be consumed by production issues such that you do not make progress on anything you originally planned to work on that day. </p>

                      <h3>Are there often new challenges in your role and what are some examples? </h3>
                        <p>Yes, as technology is always advancing there are always new challenges either in learning a new technology or solving new problems.
                          The gradual migration from .NET Framework to .NET Core and now .NET has forced us to carefully think about and migrate our codebase to move forward with new .NET versions while still supporting applications on old ones. Internally we use common code modules that needed to be re-worked to work on all .NET versions simultaneously.
                          As integration has moved from file-based transfers to web API’s, I have had to learn to both consume APIs as well as plan, design and host our own while meeting performance and reliability targets.
                          Recently a program that processes invoices which were normally around 50 lines started having to process invoices with thousands of lines. The program could not handle this due to memory and time constraints and needed to be completely restructured with a different approach that would scale.</p>

                        <h3>In your job and maybe the I.T industry in general what do you find the skills that are most in demand and which ones would you say you utilize the most? </h3>
                          <p>In my field specifically .NET is a useful skill to have and there are many jobs for .NET Developers. Most of the time companies are looking for “Full Stack” developers, who need to be capable of both front and back-end development. C# and SQL are the skills I use most often.
                            In the wider industry cloud skills are in very high demand (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).</p>

                          <h3>Do you find you work mostly in a team, individually or is it a mixture of both? ?</h3>
                            <p4>As I manage a team of only 1 other person generally, I am working on my own projects and delegating tasks to the other developer. Communication in the team is constant. </p>

                            <h3>Being an RMIT graduate. How did you find your experience there and do you think you were job ready at the end of it? </h3>
                              <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my degree, particularly the later years as I was able to specialise more. Because of the side scope of languages and topics covered throughout my course I had a very strong foundation in programming, which meant that I was able to quickly adapt to the particular technology (.NET) of the job I got after university. </p>

                              <h3>The field in which you work, is this the field you wanted to get into and if not, what field would be your ideal? </h3>
                                <p>This is my ideal field, and I am still very satisfied working in it 10 years on. </p>

                                <h3>Any advice you would give to someone that is just starting in I.T and any areas in your opinion that would be good areas of focus?</h3>
                                  <p>Try to find something that interests you or that you are passionate about and see if you can focus on that.
                                    Have a look at open job offerings, such as on Stack Overflow jobs, and read the job descriptions and skills required. This will give you a good idea of what skills are in demand.
                                    If possible, find a project you can do in your own time to get your feet wet in these skills. This is also very good to have on your CV when applying for jobs.
                                    Although I have been at the same job for 10 years, this is very uncommon in the IT industry. Most people move jobs every few years, so it may be worth first getting your foot in the door at any company even if it is not your ideal job.
                                    There has been a very big push towards cloud computing, and skills in this area apply to many IT roles not just software development. I think this would be a very good area to invest time in.</p>

            <h3>Small computing devices - Raspberry Pi </h3>
            <p>By Ilya Anderson</p>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a low energy consuming, yet high processing powered, Linux based, single board computer roughly the
                 size of a deck of cards that is aimed at students and tech enthusiasts who want to learn about computers and programming.
                 It can be simply connected to a TV, mouse and keyboard and opens the door to computing, programming and development to anyone,
                 even those with no experience, through a vast amount of learning resources provided by its user community (Opensource 2021).
                 It is a part of a group of hugely popular small computing devices including Arduino, Beagleboard and a host of similar products
                 with varying CPU’s that are commonly used as the base of low cost and relatively simple IT projects. The RPi’s development is
                 driven by a charity-based foundation with the goal of:</p>

                 <p>“the ability to deliver computing education without the need for elaborate infrastructure”. (Shah, A 2016). This is achieved
                   through its low-cost hardware and free opensource software. </p>
                   <img src="raspberry pi.png" alt="photo of raspberry pi"/>
                   <p>Raspberry Pi 4 model B (Raspberry Pi, 2021).</p>
                     <h4>How is it cutting edge tech? </h4>
                     <p>First released in 2012, The RPi initially had an ARM based 700MHz single core CPU and 256MB RAM. While this sounds under whelming,
                      it was an instant hit with students, hobbyists, and developers as it cost only $35 and opened the door to anyone wanting to learn
                      programming and development of hardware-based projects (Opensource 2021). It has since increased its computing power capabilities with
                      several product updates due to falling hardware sizes and prices allowing it to maintain its low cost, a key criterion, and further software development.
                      The latest iteration is the Raspberry Pi 4 which has a 1.5 GHz ARM based CPU and 8GB RAM which increases its ability to handle heavier applications, as
                      well as a dedicated 64 bit Linux based RPi OS to take advantage of the RAM increase (Fenlon, W 2020). While the hardware specs are not cutting-edge
                      technology, the RPi’ ability for anyone to “get under the hood” and tinker with IT projects is.</p>

                      <h4>What does it allow us to do?</h4>
                      <p>While the RPi can do usual computer user tasks such as internet browsing, watching videos and word processing and has the usual array of interfaces
                      such as USBs, WIFI, Ethernet, HDMI and Bluetooth it also contains a easily accessible GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which can be programmed
                      with Scratch, Python or C++ to interact with external hardware and electrical components such as drive motors, LEDs and an array of sensors such as
                      temperature, light, sound, cameras, actuators or radar to name a few (Future Learn 2021). Due to its “back to basics” form and its low price it has broken
                      down barriers to entry into the programming and development world, is a regular inclusion into school computing curriculums and its use has also crossed over
                      into hacking and making communities (Street, M, & Chidlow, W 2020).</p>

                      <h4>What will it allow us to do in the future?</h4>
                      <p>Applications for the RPi are only limited by imagination. It can be used to learn to code or develop electronics projects and is often used as a platform of IoT projects as it contains a microcontroller to process data, Wi-Fi for data transmission and GPIOs for actuator control. Some common projects are: WIFI print servers, ad blocking Pi Hole, streaming device, retro game emulator, WIFI extender, Twitter bot, basic desktop computer, network monitoring tool, smart mirror, NAS (Network Attached Storage) command centre (Locker, A 2021). There is a huge variety of what can be developed with an RPi, and as innovation and development allows the inclusion of higher powered but low-cost CPU’s and other associated hardware, further possibilities will be realised.  </p>
                      <p>The development of the RPi and its support network has also made it feasible to use RPi’s for industrial use in areas such as automation, robotics, and other embedded applications. This has been achieved though the development of the RPi Compute Module which enables rapid prototyping and production of IoT imbedded commercial products (Hallsten Innovations 2021).  <p/>

                      <h4>What is the likely impact of RPI Development? </h4>
                      <p>The RPi is also being used in developing countries where the lack of appropriate educational facilities and infrastructure are some of the leading causes for low education and poverty. The lack of support for computer science education was a problem identified by MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte who with the help of the United Nations Development Program initiated the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. However, this program failed to reach its objective of mass distribution of low-cost laptops to developing countries due to rising costs and other reasons (Shah, N 2020). With the same goal in mind, the RPi was developed with simplicity and low cost being its key features and weighing only 45 grams per unit helped reduce the financial and logistical constraints for developing countries to access technological infrastructure. Additionally, the computer facilitated an easily transported electronic library for providing education in many subject areas (Neupane, S 2015).</p>
                      <h4>What is likely to change?</h4>
                      <p>Increasing performance and falling costs and sizing of hardware links directly with RPi’s success as a small computer. The RPI will also facilitate further interest in IoT embedded systems driven by the need to understand and automate aspects of human interaction with their surroundings such as Smart Homes and Smart Appliances. The reduction in hardware size while increasing capability is the precursor of the future development of nano computers. This will accelerate the inclusion of IoT into many aspects of life.</p>

                      <h4>Will this create or make jobs or technologies redundant?</h4>
                      <p>The RPi’s low cost and ease of use has increased student interest in programming which is evident in over 30 million boards being sold and is also seen in the increase of other manufactures producing similar small computing single boards (Tung, L 2019). The RPi also filled a gap in computers appropriate for beginners to learn coding on because computers today are predominately bought as complex consumer items rather than coding machines, whereas in 80’s, home computers were simple enough to learn programming on by copying codes printed in computer magazines which inevitably required the user to debug and therefore learned programming out of necessity (Two-bit history 2021). </p>

                      <h4>How will I be affected in my daily life?</h4>
                      <p>I was exposed to computers since the early 1980’s with a steady stream of IBM PC’s using intel 8088 microprocessors and onwards and learned some programming by copying games out of computer magazines in Basic and debugged exactly as what was written earlier so I can appreciate the simplicity of the RPI. I hope my daughter can enjoy the simplicity of these small computers and gain an appreciation for IT. I also expect that with the addition of microcomputers and embedded IoT systems into an increasing number of everyday items the efficiency of common tasks will be increased through the minimisation of human involvement. The RPi is still mainly focused on students and enthusiasts, however the growth of RPi for industrial applications may also see it play a role in the lives of friends and family. Small computers are already part of their lives in areas such as monitoring consumer good supply chains, monitoring of buildings and homes, home network devices and TV’s and in processes used in manufacturing consumer goods.</p>

              <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
                <p>By Ben Vaka'uta</p>
                <h4>What is an autonomous vehicle also known as self-driving vehicles?</h4>
                <p>For those of us old enough to watch the Knight Rider TV show series in the mid to late 80s. K.I.T.T was the unrestructured black self-driving and talking Pontiac Firebird Trans Am car that was the coolest car we ever seen on TV.  When I think autonomous vehicle, I pictured K.I.T.T from the Knight Rider tv show. The fantasy from that age group has started to materialize in vehicle technology like the Tesla model S, X, 3 and Y. According to Tesla, their vehicle hardware is equipped with autonomous driving or as Tesla called it, auto pilot capability.</p>
                <p>Tesla is a little more advanced than other manufacturers with autonomous vehicles available on the market today.  Tesla vehicle has multiple forward cameras that covers wide, narrow, and main with range between 60 metres to 250 metres. It has rear view camera with a range of 50 metres, as well as forward side camera with a range of 80 metres.  Beside the cameras, it also has an ultrasonics sensor with range of 8 metres and Radar with range of 160 metres. It has an onboard computer to process all these data and enable the car to become an autonomous vehicle. With this hardware, Tesla offer autosteer+, this is where the vehicle can navigate on road with complex lane, change lane etc.  It has smart summon, where a Telsa owner to recall the Tesla car from a parking lot etc. (Tesla, 2021).  </p>
                  <p>Other car manufacturer like Nissan and GM use lane departure warning systems on their current vehicles available on the market but are still behind Tesla by a few years. With Nissan some of the features that offer in the direction of autonomous vehicles include lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, rear automatic braking when backing up, blind spot warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. (Brauer, Karl, 2021). However, with all these advancements in autonomous vehicle, there are roadblocks to the development of autonomous vehicle.  </p>
                    <p>According to IEEE, there are three roadblocks, the first roadblock is data privacy concern, the data processed and recorded by the vehicle computer include, how fast the vehicle is travelling on the road compare to the speed limit, the attentiveness of the driver to the road, is the vehicle operated in an aggressive or normal manner, etc. If this information is shared with the driver’s insurance carrier this could impact their insurance premium either in a positive or negative way. This information could potentially be used in court to prosecute the driver if they have broken the law or were involved in an accident.  The second roadblock is lack of Intelligent Infrastructure, not all roads are constructed equally. Some roads might not have the proper signage to allow the vehicle to identify the road speed limit, special condition for the road like a lane merging, intersection etc. Road could be fitted with sensors to provide road conditions to the vehicles travelling on that road, like how wet the road is and other conditions that would assist the autonomous vehicle with keeping the car and passengers safe on the road. The third roadblock is lack of standards. Tesla is developing their own hardware and software for autonomous driving, GM, Nissan, and others are developing their own inhouse hardware and software to progress their individual autonomous vehicle program.  These vehicle manufactures are not working together to create a standard. (IEEE Innovation at work 2021). Not only that, but each country also has its own law where autonomous vehicle manufactures must adhere to when applying for license to sell and allow their autonomous vehicle to operate on the country public roads and highways. What is clear is that most of the world largest car manufacturers are developing technologies to enable their vehicle models to become fully autonomous in the near future. It is a race to have a vehicle available on the market with full autonomous driving capability, however these manufacturers have not agreed on an industry standard and it seems that everyone is pushing their own proprietary solution. </p>
                    <h4>What is the impact of autonomous vehicles?</h4>
                      <p>Employment in transportation sectors, taxi drivers, delivery drivers, truck drivers, forklift driver have a grim future with securing long-term employment thanks to the advancement in autonomous vehicles. They will find in the near future that taxi, uber and FedEx delivery to name a few no longer require a human driver. Car dealership main find that people will no longer require to own a vehicle 24hrs a day 7 days a week because they can summon a vehicle to pick them up and take them from A to B reducing maintenance cost, capital cost for purchasing the vehicle outright, requiring a space to park the vehicle etc. When the utilization cost of personal transportation is affordable to the mass, it will open up other opportunities like elderlies/senior citizens can enjoy sightseeing on a private ride on mountain side, beach and other tourist hotspots from the privacy of an autonomous car. This is what the autonomous industry technology companies are aiming for like start up Cruise LLC which this week got the backing from the like of Microsoft and GM. (Welch, David 2021).    </p>
                      <p>There will be new job creations to maintain these new autonomous vehicles.  There will be new industry to recycle these vehicles at the end of its lifecycle for example recycle batteries. Vehicle manufacturer like Renault is planning ways to optimized recycling of these old batteries from Autonomous vehicles. (Engineerlive, 2021). This will contribute to reducing the pollution on the environment and old hardware are not being recycled and instead send to the land fill. Jobs that might post danger to a human driver or operator, like operating heavy machineries on a cliff or mountain can be accomplished by autonomous vehicle.  Its profitable businesses as autonomous vehicles can operate 24hrs a day, where human drivers need break. </p>
                      <h4>Impact of autonomous vehicles on me?</h4>
                      <p> I will have more time to do other things like enjoying the road, sightseeing then having to focus on operating the vehicle when travelling to outer states and long-distance trips. I might not have to own the vehicle outright. I can subscribe to a car share subscription where the car picks me up when I need a transportation and drop me off when I am done. I can go to places where it is difficult to find parking or where parking is expensive because there is no extra cost due to the vehicle not having to park there and wait for me.  I suspect that this will be cheaper option then having to purchase a car outright, pay for insurance, maintenance, and a place to store the vehicle when not in use. I will not need a driver license, so when I get older it will not inhibit me from making private trip to the beach, park etc.  There should be less vehicles on the road and because the vehicle is autonomous it will be more efficient in finding the optimum route to my destination and higher safety standard then human driving. With less vehicles on the road also mean less pollution to the environment and I get to enjoy fresh air around me.  According to Thales group, autonomous vehicle will reduce harmful emissions by 60%, 90% reduction in traffic deaths, increase lane capacity by 500%, reduce travel time by 40%, consumer save heaps of money, eliminate stop and go traffic by 100% and improve fuel economy by 10%. (Thales Group 2017).  Future looks bright with autonomous vehicle development. </p>

                <h3>Robots</h3>
                <p>By Jayden Warrell</p>
                <h3>Defining state of the art</h3>
                  <p>Robots are a broad technology and could be defined as programmable machinery which can carry out tasks autonomously or semi-autonomous (CSstanford edu 2020). The earliest digitally programmable robot was to be invented in 1954, although the first model was not industrialized until the mid-60’s (Mind project 2011). They consist of four main components being a body, controller, sensors, and actuators such as pistons or motors. The controller acts as a device which can be programmed with instructions, the sensor detects the surroundings, the actuator receives signals to allow for movement, and the body simply encases materials and moulds parts. These machines are designed to help humans achieve greater accomplishments and their typical purpose is to perform tasks that can simulate human efficiency. Since 2010 the global stock deployed in industries has more than doubled (oxford economics 2020). Some explanation for this development is cost efficiency, enhancements in productivity, and the reduced requirement for human manual labour. </p>
                  <p>Today there are around 2.7 million robots installed in industries across the world (world robotics 2020). This is due to the effectiveness in sectors such as agriculture, health care, military but mostly manufacturing. Some of the specific jobs they carry out within these sectors include constructing automotive instruments in assembly lines, conveying communication, aiding surgeons to perform surgical operations, or emulating human locomotion to supply prosthetic limbs. Robots can even outperform humans in persistency and accuracy. It comes as no surprise that companies around the world want to invest in the technology for industrial use. It is estimated that by 2030 around 20 million jobs will be replaced by robots in the global manufacturing industry alone (oxford economics 2020). </p>
                  <p>In current times there are many plans to deliver future developments in robots that will make an impact in the years to come. New robot models are being suggested that will integrate advancements in data analysis and cloud technology. This could reduce the demand for individual programming and link robots to communicate through sensors across a network. Analyst are predicting a high marketing trend for this type of model as it will implement higher networking capability and allow robots to work more collectively (IFR 2020). Another advancement that is gaining traction, is to apply artificial intelligence at the core of industrial robots. AI assimilated robots are expected to drive market growth 15% by 2027(Robotics Tomorrow 2010-2021). Rather than supplementing current versions with AI components, the innovation is to redesign robots that revolve around artificial intelligence. The assimilation would grant robots the ability to be receptive and adapt to changing conditions more independently in the workforce. Therefore, delivering greater autonomy to robots in general due to AI systems guiding the functions. This requires completely new designs, but the advantages could eliminate factors such as human error and achieve greater speed or efficiency. It becomes a clear trend that advancements in other technology such as machine learning, AI, and cloud networking have the potential to improve robots. </p>
                  <h3>Likely Impact</h3>
                  <p>Robots have become valuable assets to society but have caused a significant societal shift in the process. They are improving quality of production but also coincidentally drive a competition to employment. It is estimated that adding one robot to any geological location will reduce employment in that area by six workers (MITsloanschool 2020). The main industries effected by this scenario would be mining, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and mostly the manufacturing-automotive sector (robodDKinc 2020). It is worth noting the main jobs that will be affected are tedious, hazardous, or unwanted tasks. This therefore reduces risk of injury and poor job satisfaction. This is because the initiative of combining technology to the workforce is not to replace humans in their jobs, but to make practices safer and more practical. Nonetheless, jobs that are hazardous, simply automated, or unskilled could become entirely redundant. Contrary to replacing these jobs, they are also generating new roles that did not previously exist. This will change industries as it prompts the demand for new jobs entirely, that require skilled workers instead of unskilled labour (investopedia2020). Some of the work likely to be generated would revolve around collaborating with robots and designing the implementation of robots into the workforce. This could particularly create new roles such as robotics managers or artificial intelligence teachers (sam-solution1993-2021). This might also result in new industries being generated, including work to design and use automation. </p>

                  <h3>Effect on my daily life</h3>
                  <p>Robots are increasingly effecting society as they progress and begin to be met in a variety of day-to-day scenarios. Firstly, the impact will reduce the need for my friends to complete hazardous and hard manual labour jobs. Also, my perception of the industry will change heavily as it seems more jobs are highly susceptible to automation such as occupations that include predictable physical work, data processing and data collection (Mckinseyreport1996-2021). I consider this effecting my family a lot since I have relatives in mining who insist robots are already being scheduled to underground operations. This is arguably affecting their livelihoods to an extent already. I also see the use of minor non-advanced cleaning robots being used in certain households and elegant businesses regularly. When I was a child seeing these models would not be common. Considering this technology is partially new on a grand scale, I will have the privilege to perceive the changes this type of technology will make to entertainment and business long term.</p>

                  <h3>Network security</h3>
                  <p>by Jason Halse</p>
                    <p>Network security is a set of rules and structures designed to protect the integrity, hardware and software. All companies and/or organizations need some level of network security in todays’ landscape to protect themselves against the ever growing and changing threats that are out there.  </p>
                    <p>There are many different tools that we can use to help improve our network security some of these include.  </p>
                  <ul class="keySkills">
          <li>Antivirus programs. (Norton, McAfee, Avast). These programs detect viruses and hopefully remove them before they infect your computer.</li>
          <li>Firewalls. This can be either software or hardware. It puts up a barrier between the computer which is on a trusted network and untrusted networks allowing the user to allow or block incoming traffic. </li>
          <li>VPN. Also known as a Virtual Private Network the role of a VPN is to encrypt your connection to the internet which makes it harder to trace and track. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>One of the emerging technologies coming out of the network security sector and oner that has garnered my interest is VDN or Virtual Dispersive Networking. So, what this basically does is disperse the information being sent across multiple data streams with inly the end user receiving 100% of the data sent. This means hackers will only get small chunks of the data making it almost useless. This is particularly useful against MiM attacks (Man in the Middle).  </p>
          <p>This will not so much impact the wider community as the way in we would send data from a user point of view would not change. This would impact the security threats i.e., hackers. As the data in its entirety would be harder to obtain therefore the hackers would have to come up with new ways to obtain data. I am hoping this becomes a more mainstream way of sending data both for the professionals and for the general public. In sending data this way our privacy will be more protected as data farmers would only be able to get bits and pieces of our personal data. As yet this will not affect me or my family in our daily lives as this is not a mainstream way of sending data.  </p>

            <h1>Project Ideas - Automated Greenhouse</h1>
            <h1>Monitoring microclimate conditions to increase growth</h1>
            </div>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p> The group project is an automated climate control attachment that can be fitted to small commercially available greenhouses that are approximately 1m x 1m x 1.5m and costing between $30 - $60 at Bunnings and similar big box hardware warehouse.
                The automated control unit is driven by an Arduino microcontroller and contains temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content sensors. These sensors relay information inside the unit to the Arduino which then controls an inlet fan and a water source to maintain predetermined conditions by the user.
                The device is aimed at the gardening enthusiast with the goal to simplify plant care though automation and to provide an ideal growth environment for potted plants. It is simple, low cost, and is portable and lightweight for ease of positioning around the garden or balcony.</p>

              <p>Low cost greenhouse as supplied from Bunnings

              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>The current global pandemic has obligated people to stay at home more and many have turned to hobbies and other housebound activities for entertainment. This is evident with increased revenues from large retailers of household and gardening supplies in Australia  and the booming plant bazaars, nurseries and increases in online sellers throughout Bangkok. The increase in gardening popularity is not only from those with a garden but also from apartment dwellers growing plants indoor or on the balcony. The most popular plants during this period are ornamental due to their beauty and value. These types of plants require extra care to maintain optimal leaf, shoot and root growth with the slightest deviation ruining the appearance of the decorative foliage.
              The automation of garden care processes is possible using inexpensive sensors, microcontrollers and other simple hardware. This allows conditions inside the greenhouse to be monitored and maintained for the users and their plants benefit from the optimal conditions it provides.  </p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Many plants species are grown as a hobby because of their beauty, popularity, and rarity. This rarity is due to not being native to the local environment and are either sourced from other parts of the country or overseas. The problem with growing these types of plants is that local environmental conditions may not be optimal for their growth. Therefore, increased maintenance is required to maintain plant health and a visually appealing foliage.
                  Additionally, free space around the home may be subjected to extremes of sunlight or shade that are unfavourable for growing plants. This is where a controlled environment offered by an automated greenhouse can be a solution. It can increase the range of plant species that can be grown in the local environment and is achieved by tailoring the conditions in the greenhouse specifically to the plant’s requirements. Additionally, potted plants can be cycled through the greenhouse as a nurturing boost before being placed back into areas where they can have maximum viewing pleasure.</p>
                <p>The focus of the project is not on the overall greenhouse structure due to a large variety of small, cheap, and portable versions already available on the marked. The projects focus is to provide an additional unit that can be attached to the front of a prebought greenhouse with simple modifications, connected to a power and water source, and create a stable environment tailored to the user’s requirements.
                  Through automation, the greenhouse will measure the greenhouse conditions and apply resources as required to maintain a predetermined condition. Maintaining soil moisture content is achieved by timing the opening a sprinkler in the early morning or evening as required to increase moisture but not humidity. Humidity is controlled by opening a misting spray during the warmer parts of the day or turning on a ventilation fan. Temperature is controlled by operating a heating lamp or fan, and lighting is controlled by manipulating a shade blind. Soil nutrient content could also be available however the sensor would have to be manually moved from pot to pot. For simplicity, these features can be added or removed as components.  </p>
                  <p>The automation of these processes also allows for the capacity to capture data to SD card or transmit data via WIFI which enables the user to begin with a benchmark and then experiment with different greenhouse conditions to find optimal growth. This information could also be shared with other users of similar systems and open discussions related to best practice or find solutions to remedy problems. Further expansions could be related to web based, monitoring, control, and forum discussion. While the options for variations to parameters are nearly endless, it could include pre-installed settings allowing it for plug and play which would make it more commercially appealing. Condition settings could also be manipulated by enthusiasts to achieve a better outcome or grow a larger variety of species. </p>

                  <h3>Tools & Tech</h3>
                    <p>The automated greenhouse is based on inexpensive kit form greenhouses available at most big box hardware outlets or online retailers. The size is based on the popular 1m x 1m x 1.5 model and could be scaled up slightly to accommodate larger models available such as 1.50m x 1.50m x 1.95m, however retaining a small footprint and portability is one of the key objectives.
                      To monitor the conditions inside the greenhouse, readily available low-cost sensors will be used to measure soil moisture content, humidity, and temperature. (Appendix 1). The sensor data will be input to an Arduino which will then output signals to switch relays which will operate water pumps, water solenoid valves, fan, and a heating lamp. The unit is triangular shaped and is designed to fit into the gable on the front of the greenhouse. This will contain the microcontroller, sensors and relays and the conditions inside will be displayed on the LCD at the front. The soil sensor will be placed in a pot of the user’s choice and misting sprays attached to the top of the greenhouse by the user. Power is supplied by a normal power point, however it could also be adapted to use a battery and solar cell.
                      The unit can be broken down into several components and it is possible to add each component in stages as the user desires. This is simply done by attaching the connectors from the new sensor or other device to the Arduino and updating the firmware via PC.
                      WIFI connectivity is also a planned feature with the addition of the low cost ESP8266 WIFI Module and opens many possibilities for user interaction.</p>

                    <h3>Skills required</h3>
                      <p>The bare greenhouse is a commercially available unit that requires little skill to assemble. The automation module contains the integration of several component projects aimed at IT students and IT enthusiasts. The Arduino and associated sensors and components are available online for little cost.  The Arduino uses C++ programming and while our group lacks the required experience, these products are aimed at beginners and there is a large amount of information available online for free. The project will require basic electronics knowledge for hardware setup to interface the sensor inputs with the Arduino and coding for Arduino to send and receive signals from sensors to servos and switches. An anticipated issue is the soil moisture content will be sensing just one pot in the greenhouse and watering will be based on that one input and may not be a representative of the condition of other pots. It is proposed that the automation unit will be developed in stages as the required competencies are attained.</p>

                      <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The outcome of a successful project would be a marketable product that could be produced relatively cheaply and allow small hobby gardens to be set up in a variety of small spaces. It could also benefit busy people as it may reduce time needed to maintain a small garden. Additionally, the unit would provide data that is not able to be obtained with normal hands on gardening. The data capture aspect could also help form a gardening community that was interested in a more structured approach that was results driven through benchmarking and measurable improvements. There is also the possibility that it could be scaled to suit much larger applications. </p>
