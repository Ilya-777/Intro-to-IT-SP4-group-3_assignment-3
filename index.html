                        <h3>Ilya Anderson: S3760258</h3>
                          <p>I have been working for an oil and gas drilling services provider for the last 13 years in Australia, Brunei, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Thailand where I currently
                            reside with my wife and 6yr old daughter. Due to the oil industry being in decline since 2014, I have been engaged in tertiary studies to help facilitate a career transition to another
                            industry. I first completed a diploma of business at TAFE in 2018 and am now beginning my final year of a business degree in logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. </p>
                            <p>During my careerin the oil industry, I was exposed to IT in the form of PLC driven automated equipment and some networking troubleshooting. My hobbies include riding motorcycle’s around Thailand and
                              tinkering with various IT projects around the house. For example, I recently purchased an old Dell Optiplex PC and upgraded it into a cheap gaming desktop. I also recently made a wireless
                              print server with an old printer and a raspberry pi zero. Another project I am currently working on is an Arduino driven automated greenhouse which is tied to my current university studiest
                              and is also a personal interest. </p>
                                <a href="https://ilya-777.github.io/ePortfolio/">https://ilya-777.github.io/ePortfolio/</a>
                        <h3>Jayden Warrell: S3882576</h3>
                          <p>this is my first course to study through RMIT. To tell you more about myself, I grew and reside in Townsville Northern Queensland. I enjoy gym, athletics and
                            reading within my spare time. Before studying this course my highest achieved education was completing high school in 2014. After school I worked in various roles throughout mining and retail but am now
                            employed in hospitality.
                            <p>I believe my IT experience is at a basic level and limitted to basic hardware & software. Throughout my employment in mining, I have used ERP systems such as pronto and used the
                              programs to communicate safety procedures, stock levels and tasks throughout the company. I have seen directly how efficient information technology can be in a company. I personally believe it will
                              be much more utilized in the future as it develops which I find fascinating. I hope to increase my understanding and build applicable knowledge by participating with Average Joes in our group project. </p>

                      <h3>Sharif Ayazi: S3815095</h3>
                        <p> My name is Sharif Ayazi. I love playing with code and designing. I have finished my diploma and advanced diploma at Chisholm TAFE in Victoria three years ago.  I stopped studying for 2 years and now I am continuing again. I am a full-time employee working at a vehicle parts supply company. I have some experience of web design. We are using the Pinnacle system at the current company that I am one of their employees. The Pinnacle system is a powerful stock management system which can identify and display all the details of a car from mechanical parts to panels and print tags, scan, display inventoried parts lists on the company’s website, produce invoices and many other functions. I start studying IT again to achieve to my goal of furthering my IT career and make myself more familiar in programming. I have joined the Average Joes team towards the end of this assignment.</p>

                        <h3>Ben Vaka'uta: S3888875</h3>
                          <p>My wife and I moved to Melbourne from Auckland, NZ in March 2020, and Victoria shut down the borders shortly after that.  I have been in IT for 15yrs, started off from the IT Helpdesk, Desktop Support and now IT Infrastructure Engineer working fulltime.  During the 15yrs in IT I have done self-study for IT related certification to further my career development.  Some of the IT certification that I have completed include CompTIA A+, Network+, Microsoft MCP, Microsoft MCSE, and various Microsoft Servers certification from NT 4.0 to 2012R2.  In the last few years, I have found that my job is shifting a lot from being and IT Admin into a DevOps job which requires programming knowledge.  This include PowerShell, CLI and python, however I have resisted learning new programming language except for PowerShell because some of my daily tasks requires knowledge.  I am not proficient in PowerShell, but I know how to read the help syntax complete the task at hand.  I am taking this degree to have a formal qualification, learn about formal programming and cloud architecture.</p>

                          <h3>Jason Halse: S3882583</h3>
                            <p>I decided I wanted to change careers and so I am doing this course through RMIT. I am a chef by trade and because my circumstances changed i could no longer work in the hospitality industry, since then I have been working as a swimming pool technician, but this is just a job and not a career. I have always had an interest in I.T as I love building, repairing, and troubleshooting all types of technology from computers to kids toys I find myself repairing rather than throwing it away. My main passion has and always will be computers though I am just fascinated in how fast they have and probably will continue to evolve and what we as humans now rely on them to do for us. Although I have no formal experience in I.T I have always fixed and shown family and friends computer and taught them how to best optimise their software and hardware to achieve what they want to do with their systems. I build computers as a hobby and in my job, I am constantly repairing and programming chlorinators which in themselves are just mini computers. I am a very introvert person and hope that having to work within a group like The Average Joes this will help with me being nervous with working in a team.</p>

        <h1>Team profile</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="sectionContent">
        <h3>Ilya Anderson</h3>
          <p>Ilya is a neutral introvert / extrovert. His character is neither shy and reserved or overbearing. His balanced intuitive and observant style combines problem solving with past and future learning alongside hard observable facts. He exerts balanced decision making and emotional restraint.
            His positive attributes towards group work are his goals orientated motivation, and a dependable and positive outlook on group task attainment. He is also able to withstand difficult situations deliver successful outcomes.
            His negative attributes are that he is overly opinionated, dislikes criticism and is has difficulty encouraging and supporting team members when required for enhanced group cohesion. He can be inpatient, critical and aggressive, and dislikes long meetings, instead he prefers to dive straight into the task.
            His work style preference is that where personnel operate in a traditional and conventional, structured environment with a clear job role hierarchy. He prefers hands on work rather than analytical work and a work plan that is clearly set out towards goal attainment.
            To learn new concepts, he prefers to see them demonstrated in practice, experiment with new ideas to find solutions.  </p>

          <h3>Jayden Warrell</h3>
            <p>Jayden is more of an introvert and is more intuitive than observant meaning that he would rather discuss theories for decision making and problem solving.
              His positive attributes toward group work are his creativity, flexibility, and analysis. He also has a positive outlook with a healthy ego and is collaborative, open minded and imaginative.
              His negative attributes are that his contribution may be sometimes impractical, and he can also be absent minded and insensitive. This is where he must be mindful to remain well organized and demonstrate a strong sense of self discipline.
              His work style preferences are more flexible than structured work method. He also prefers non-traditional rather than conventional work structure. He would rather analyse problems rather than apply practical applications to gain the knowledge required to solve problems. He would rather not be in a leadership position but would prefer to be a key asset in the team.
              Jayden’s reserved nature with a tendency to be less directly talkative and reluctance to act are the key areas to be mindful of when in a team environment. However, his preference to be conscientious and helpful to others and goals driven are strong assets for team contribution.  </p>

              <h3>Ben Vaka'uta</h3>
                  <p>Ben is balanced extraverted / introverted. He prefers to gain insight from past experiences and places his agreeableness as a high level of importance. He is highly imaginative and often questioning the big picture and what if scenarios.
                    He is conscious of knowledge areas he wishes to expand upon to allow for greater team contribution and is prepared to develop those shortcomings to make himself a more valuable team member. This is evident in his IT course attainment to remedy any knowledge shortcomings. When in a team situation he prefers to surround himself with strong and knowledgeable individuals in area where he can develop the skill sets and experience through hands on learning.</p>

                <h3>Jason Halse</h3>
                  <p>Jason is more introverted than extroverted. He prefers to gain insight from past experiences and places the accuracy of his contributions as a high level of importance. He prefers to take a scientific approach to problem solving and would rather use his head than his feelings. He also prefers flexibility when dealing with problems rather than a structured approach. This allows him to react to situations rather than attempt to control them.
He also prefers to gain knowledge by a hands-on learning process. This is easier for him to retain knowledge through physical movement. His hand on learning preference means that he likes to tinker with projects to gain insight and develop solutions.  On the contrary, he finds it harder to retain knowledge and understanding when listening to something. He responds well to encouragement and uses this to reinforce his decisions that are 100% in line with the group’s objectives.
Jason’s quiet and reserved yet calculated working preference enables him to deliver valuable team contributions, however, he does not like asking for help and finds it very nerve racking when it comes to group meetings and discussions.
To be a key team member he should be speak up and open a clear dialogue of his ideas, contributions, and opinions of team workings. More hands-on experience in teams and positive reinforcement should see him more comfortable in the future.</p>

                  <h3>Sharif Ayazi</h3>
                    <p>according to structure above indicates that I am more extravert rather is more than Introvert. More comfortable in group work. Willing to solve issues. Willing to assist in a team. Consider work hard to be efficient in team. like to share idea. disinterested to criticism other. </p>

          <h1> Ideal Jobs</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="sectionContent">

          <h3>Ilya Anderson:  ERP Systems Implementation</h3>
            <p>My ideal area for employment is in ERP system implementation and integration such as SAP or Dynamics 365 Business Central system. This would involve sales demonstrations, solution designing and implementation, customer training and support. Ideally it would be in the logistics and supply chain industry.
              The required hard skills are a business degree, experience in ERP implementation, warehouse management, design and layout experience, as well as extensive Microsoft excel experience and basic SQL and CRM experience and customer support.
              The required soft skills are strong communication and problem-solving skills, analytical skills with attention to detail and business acumen skills, strong time and workload management.
              This job ties into my interest in business process optimisation and project management as well as my career experience and current business degree studies.</p>
              <p>My pathway to achieving this goal is to continue with my business degree studies and supplement with ERP training available online. Additionally, further studies crossing over into IT would also be beneficial in areas of cloud infrastructure and software development. At the completion of my business degree, I wish to be employed in the supply chain industry to gain real world experience with supply chain focused software applied to warehouse management and transport management and other business processes. After gaining an overview of warehouse operation, my next step would be to gain employment as a member of an ERP implementation team where my warehouse operations knowledge can be applied to the implementation of ERP software, facilitating changes in software where required and optimising business processes to align with software capability. </p>

              <h3>Jayden Warrell:  ICT Security architect</h3>
              <p>The future career I hope to pursue, is an ICT security architect. They specialise in protecting a company’s information from loss or leakage and ensure safety structures are effective. They are generally responsible for testing, designing, and implementing security infrastructure within a system. They more specifically achieve this by maintaining or installing security software, performing, regulating access of employees to the system based on roles, reviewing systems with ethical hacking or penetration testing, responding to data breaches, and implementing improvements or procedures.</p>
              <p>This role is continuously challenging and desirable to me since it carries such high significance. The reason being how cyber-attacks are growing threats to any industry which relies on technology to store prized information. These attacks are usually intended to manipulate a company or sell any valuable data for financial gain. The outcome could devastate an organisation, essentially resulting in espionage. </p>
              <p>Entering this position would certainly require hard skills such as an IT associated bachelor’s degree, experience with security controls such as firewalls, knowledge of windows server, and an understanding of UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Furthermore, the ideal soft skills involve problem solving, planning, troubleshooting, strong communication and critical thinking. I express a strong passion to one day achieve this title and a realistic approach will be to complete my bachelor’s degree. In addition, I will need to complete further courses based on security architecture to hone my skills more relevant. This may precisely refer to CEH, CISSP-ISSAP or CSSA to name a few. Lastly, it would be beneficial to proceed to work in an entry level IT position to gain field experience in applying my certified knowledge.</p>

              <h3>Ben Vaka'uta: IT Solution or Infrastructure Architect</h3>
              <p>I would like to move to an IT Solution Architect or IT Infrastructure Architect. However, I am seeing a lot of companies' IT Infrastructure moving to the cloud as IaaS and PaaS which means that some organization might not need an inhouse Solution Architect or IT Infrastructure Architect. If this trend is where IT is heading, then I will upskill to an Azure cloud IT engineer. The days of standing up a new server and configuring an exchange server for your business are numbered, thanks to Microsoft Exchange Online.</p>

              <h3>Jason Halse: ICT Support Technician </h3>
              <p>My ideal job would be an ICT support technician. They provide support for and maintenance for the computer related infrastructure. This would involve helping people setup and troubleshoot/repair every day I.T equipment and software needed to carry out their jobs. To succeed in this position, I would need a broad knowledge of computer hardware including P.C, laptops, tablets, and smart phones. I would also need a broad knowledge of the common software that is used in the environment, some of which might include windows, office 365, outlook. </p>
              <p>Although no formal qualifications are needed for this role whenever I see a job advertised, they generally ask for a diploma or bachelor’s degree in I.T I believe this course will give me the broad knowledge required to help me succeed in this role.
              Some of the skills I already possess that I think will also help are trouble shooting, customer relationships, being able to explain technical problems to non-technical people, being approachable, and being able to see problems that may otherwise be overlooked. In the current job I have I am often repairing computerised pool equipment and believe this would also be beneficial in some capacity.  </p>

              <h3>Sharif Ayaz: IT Support </h3>
              <p>My idea job is the position of IT support in the automotive Industry. The details of this position include support for current IT related resources such as desktop computers, networking equipment, printers and related software as well as providing technical recommendations to management. Additionally, the IT support position would also include development and maintenance of company websites such as adding new posts, updates, and data entry into systems.
                The hard skills that would be required for this position includes SQL, Microsoft windows, Microsoft Office, Technical support, website production, and knowledge of ERP systems such as Pinnacle, SAP and Oracle.
                The soft skills required include communication, problem solving, teamwork, trouble shooting, analytical skills and being a self-starter.
                A substantial portion of the skills can be learned on the job; however, a university degree is a solid platform to begin with.</p>

                  <p>Table 1. Group members skill set requirements.</P>

              <h3>Summary and analysis of the group's ideal jobs' required skillsets</h3>
                <p>An analysis of the groups required skill sets for their ideal jobs shows a wide spread of individual career preferences in IT. It also highlights that there is a shared common base of ground level skill for most IT jobs. Most IT related jobs typically require a university degree where the student learns not only some of the required hard skills but also some valuable soft skills such as communication, problem solving, time management and planning.</P>
                  <p>Where the required skills differ is the degree of specialised knowledge that is required for their ideal job, this could be due to the rapid change and development of new areas in IT.  Some of these specialised skills can be developed at through a structured course at university and other required skills can be developed informally using a wide range of resources available online which can be accomplished in the student’s free time prior to seeking employment, or when looking to advance an IT career. </P>
                    <p>It is also thought that with the attainment of these commonly shared base skills and through upskilling a small set of specialised skills, it may be possible to cross over into other areas of IT relatively easily.  </P>

            <h3>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
              <p>Ilya – ERP implementation lead, Logistics and Supply Chain. Employer demand for this job is High with approximately 13,111 positions reported between 2017 - 2018. </p>
              <p>Ben - IT Solution Architect and IT Infrastructure Architect. Employer demand for this job is high with approximately 13,111 positions reported between 2017 – 2018. </p>
              <p>Jayden – Security Architecture. Employer demand for this job is medium with approximately 2914 positions reported between 2017 – 2018.</p>
              <p>Jason - ICT Support Technician. Employer demand for this job is medium with approximately 3246 positions reported between 2017 – 2018.</p>
              <p>Sharif - ICT Support Technician. Employer demand for this job is medium with approximately 3246 positions reported between 2017 – 2018.</p>

              <h3>From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).  </h3>

                <p>The groups required general skills are communication, problem solving, analytical, attention to detail and business acumen, time and workload management, customer service orientated, hand on approach, mentoring, planning, critical thinking.
                  The groups required IT specific skills are SQL experience, advanced Microsoft Excel, proficiency in Microsoft office suite, knowledge of Microsoft windows, Unix and Linux platforms, ERP Warehouse management software experience, Cybersecurity, Infrastructure implementation and support.</p>

                  <h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h3>

                  <p>SQL is a required skill set for most of the group members and is the top ranked IT skill in the burning glass data. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Unix systems knowledge is closely ranked below and is followed by business analysis, technical support, customer service and Microsoft office products. IT infrastructure experience is a vital skillset as is server OS deployment, support and troubleshooting, various systems implementation and Microsoft system administration skillsets.  </p>

                  <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?  </h3>
                    <p>Communication, problem solving, and organisational skills are the required skill sets from the groups ideal jobs and are the top three greatest demanded skills. This is closely followed by teamwork, planning and collaboration skills. Time management, analytical, and self-starter skills are also highly demanded skills.   </p>

                    <h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?  </h3>
                      <p>Java script, JAVA, and graphic design are mostly not in the groups required skill sets, however as knowledge of the positions in the IT industry increase these requirements may change.</p>

                      <h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?  </h3>
                        <p>Ilya: Creativity, research and mentoring are not in my required skill set when basing my decision on the job advertisement information, however I would imagine that all of the baseline skills are important to some degree and therefore a requirement for career development.</p>
                        <p>Ben: SQL and JavaScript. I have no appetite to study SQL; however, I will study Java next semester as it’s a requirement for my degree. </p>
                        <p>Jason: SQL Javascript and Java are not in my required skill sets. </p>
                        <p>Jayden: SQL, Java and Java script are not within my required skill set although SQL may be a system relevant to distribute security architecture across. Java and java scripting are less applicable to the position.</p>

                        <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?  </h3>
                          <p>Ilya: Having studied ERP implementation at RMIT last semester, I had knowledge of skill requirements, however the burning glass data provided more refined and up to date information. I can also see that my university studies develop both soft and hard skills that are requirements in my ideal job. My pathway to this career now includes learning more about SQL as I did not realise this was such a demanded skill for data analysis which is particularly useful in warehouse inventory management. Outside of my ideal job, my hobby projects include learning C++ in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment is also a useful skill that is in high demand.</p>
                          <p>Ben: I am staying with my current ideal job because its ranked number one in Top titles.</p>
                          <p>Jayden: My opinion and insights of my ideal job have changed considerably after studying the burning glass data. It has provoked further research into the title itself. This gave me a more accurate understanding regarding details of the required skills and specific tasks entailed. I have further noticed the job is not limited to a small portion of the network to provide security across. The variations of IT- related skills can vary among many platforms specific to a company’s needs which could change among clients. I now highly regard learning Linux, Unix and Microsoft server platforms so I can understand how fundamental principles work within across all these systems. In the hope learning these hard skills will provide me a framework and help me adjust easier to learning new operating systems on demand. I also now realize how valuable troubleshooting can be as a generic skill.</p>
                          <p>Jason: No, my opinion has not changed. I like how broad the job could be. I like learning and teaching and believe that my ideal job would be a great platform for that.</p>

            <h1>IT work: Questions answered by an industry professional</h1>
            </div>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <h3>What is your job title and what does your job involve?</h3>
              <p>Senior .NET Developer. My job encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and analysis, development and testing, security and performance tuning through to final deployment of projects. I primarily develop in .NET using the C# language. </p>

              <h3>What industry do you work in and what are some of the things your job does for that industry? </h3>
                <p>I work in the logistics industry, specifically for a freight forwarder / 3PL, responsible for importing / exporting and warehousing goods.
                  The focus of almost all the projects we implement is to deliver value to our clients. This can be in the form of providing a web application for the client or our internal staff to manage operational duties more efficiently. Providing integration between the many facets of the logistics industry, such as Australian Customs, International freight forwarders, local postage services and transport companies. Automating manual tasks. Designing reports / dashboards to provide data analysis and identify trends and issues in the data of the company and clients. Building on top of the widely used logistics ERP software CargoWise 1, to provide a competitive edge to the company.</p>

                  <h3>Who are some of the people you deal with on a day-to-day basis and what role do they play in your job?</h3>
                  <ul class="keySkills">
<li>Business users (company staff): Providing requirements for new projects, reporting bugs, providing feedback on completed work.</li>
<li>Management: Providing high level direction on what to work on, reporting on workload and completed projects.</li>
<li>Development team: Assigning tasks, helping with issues, providing feedback.</li>
<li>Clients: Discussing current tasks, answering questions.</li>
<li>Third parties: Implementing, testing or reporting issues around integration. </li>
</ul>

                <h3>What some of your responsibilities in the role that you work in? </h3>
                <p>Due to the size of the company and team I work in, my role encompasses many duties that are generally split into separate roles as the development team grows larger. Some of these duties include: </p>
                <ul class="keySkills">
                <li>Requirements gathering, requirements analysis, and scoping new projects. </li>
                <li>Developing new software and maintaining existing software. </li>
                <li>Testing completed projects with clients / third parties.</li>
                <li>Managing a small team to perform the above duties. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>What are the main types of software that you use daily? </h3>
                    <p>As we are a Microsoft developer house, the tech Stack in use is primarily: C#, ASP.NET, SQL, Entity Framework. The main software I use daily:
                      Visual Studio (.NET Development), SQL Server Management Studio (SQL Development) Postman (Web API Development), Azure DevOps (Task management / Source Control), Service Desk Plus (Helpdesk tickets), Outlook (Email) </p>

                    <h3>Is there such thing as a “typical day” in your role?  </h3>
                      <p>A typical day would most likely be: 70% Project work, 20% Maintenance, 10% Communication. Every day is different, some days can be consumed by production issues such that you do not make progress on anything you originally planned to work on that day. </p>

                      <h3>Are there often new challenges in your role and what are some examples? </h3>
                        <p>Yes, as technology is always advancing there are always new challenges either in learning a new technology or solving new problems.
                          The gradual migration from .NET Framework to .NET Core and now .NET has forced us to carefully think about and migrate our codebase to move forward with new .NET versions while still supporting applications on old ones. Internally we use common code modules that needed to be re-worked to work on all .NET versions simultaneously.
                          As integration has moved from file-based transfers to web API’s, I have had to learn to both consume APIs as well as plan, design and host our own while meeting performance and reliability targets.
                          Recently a program that processes invoices which were normally around 50 lines started having to process invoices with thousands of lines. The program could not handle this due to memory and time constraints and needed to be completely restructured with a different approach that would scale.</p>

                        <h3>In your job and maybe the I.T industry in general what do you find the skills that are most in demand and which ones would you say you utilize the most? </h3>
                          <p>In my field specifically .NET is a useful skill to have and there are many jobs for .NET Developers. Most of the time companies are looking for “Full Stack” developers, who need to be capable of both front and back-end development. C# and SQL are the skills I use most often.
                            In the wider industry cloud skills are in very high demand (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).</p>

                          <h3>Do you find you work mostly in a team, individually or is it a mixture of both? ?</h3>
                            <p4>As I manage a team of only 1 other person generally, I am working on my own projects and delegating tasks to the other developer. Communication in the team is constant. </p>

                            <h3>Being an RMIT graduate. How did you find your experience there and do you think you were job ready at the end of it? </h3>
                              <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my degree, particularly the later years as I was able to specialise more. Because of the side scope of languages and topics covered throughout my course I had a very strong foundation in programming, which meant that I was able to quickly adapt to the particular technology (.NET) of the job I got after university. </p>

                              <h3>The field in which you work, is this the field you wanted to get into and if not, what field would be your ideal? </h3>
                                <p>This is my ideal field, and I am still very satisfied working in it 10 years on. </p>

                                <h3>Any advice you would give to someone that is just starting in I.T and any areas in your opinion that would be good areas of focus?</h3>
                                  <p>Try to find something that interests you or that you are passionate about and see if you can focus on that.
                                    Have a look at open job offerings, such as on Stack Overflow jobs, and read the job descriptions and skills required. This will give you a good idea of what skills are in demand.
                                    If possible, find a project you can do in your own time to get your feet wet in these skills. This is also very good to have on your CV when applying for jobs.
                                    Although I have been at the same job for 10 years, this is very uncommon in the IT industry. Most people move jobs every few years, so it may be worth first getting your foot in the door at any company even if it is not your ideal job.
                                    There has been a very big push towards cloud computing, and skills in this area apply to many IT roles not just software development. I think this would be a very good area to invest time in.</p>

            <h3>Small computing devices - Raspberry Pi </h3>
            <p>By Ilya Anderson</p>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a low energy consuming, yet high processing powered, Linux based, single board computer roughly the
                 size of a deck of cards that is aimed at students and tech enthusiasts who want to learn about computers and programming.
                 It can be simply connected to a TV, mouse and keyboard and opens the door to computing, programming and development to anyone,
                 even those with no experience, through a vast amount of learning resources provided by its user community (Opensource 2021).
                 It is a part of a group of hugely popular small computing devices including Arduino, Beagleboard and a host of similar products
                 with varying CPU’s that are commonly used as the base of low cost and relatively simple IT projects. The RPi’s development is
                 driven by a charity-based foundation with the goal of:</p>

                 <p>“the ability to deliver computing education without the need for elaborate infrastructure”. (Shah, A 2016). This is achieved
                   through its low-cost hardware and free opensource software. </p>
                   <img src="raspberry pi.png" alt="photo of raspberry pi"/>
                   <p>Raspberry Pi 4 model B (Raspberry Pi, 2021).</p>
                     <h4>How is it cutting edge tech? </h4>
                     <p>First released in 2012, The RPi initially had an ARM based 700MHz single core CPU and 256MB RAM. While this sounds under whelming,
                      it was an instant hit with students, hobbyists, and developers as it cost only $35 and opened the door to anyone wanting to learn
                      programming and development of hardware-based projects (Opensource 2021). It has since increased its computing power capabilities with
                      several product updates due to falling hardware sizes and prices allowing it to maintain its low cost, a key criterion, and further software development.
                      The latest iteration is the Raspberry Pi 4 which has a 1.5 GHz ARM based CPU and 8GB RAM which increases its ability to handle heavier applications, as
                      well as a dedicated 64 bit Linux based RPi OS to take advantage of the RAM increase (Fenlon, W 2020). While the hardware specs are not cutting-edge
                      technology, the RPi’ ability for anyone to “get under the hood” and tinker with IT projects is.</p>

                      <h4>What does it allow us to do?</h4>
                      <p>While the RPi can do usual computer user tasks such as internet browsing, watching videos and word processing and has the usual array of interfaces
                      such as USBs, WIFI, Ethernet, HDMI and Bluetooth it also contains a easily accessible GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins which can be programmed
                      with Scratch, Python or C++ to interact with external hardware and electrical components such as drive motors, LEDs and an array of sensors such as
                      temperature, light, sound, cameras, actuators or radar to name a few (Future Learn 2021). Due to its “back to basics” form and its low price it has broken
                      down barriers to entry into the programming and development world, is a regular inclusion into school computing curriculums and its use has also crossed over
                      into hacking and making communities (Street, M, & Chidlow, W 2020).</p>

                      <h4>What will it allow us to do in the future?</h4>
                      <p>Applications for the RPi are only limited by imagination. It can be used to learn to code or develop electronics projects and is often used as a platform of IoT projects as it contains a microcontroller to process data, Wi-Fi for data transmission and GPIOs for actuator control. Some common projects are: WIFI print servers, ad blocking Pi Hole, streaming device, retro game emulator, WIFI extender, Twitter bot, basic desktop computer, network monitoring tool, smart mirror, NAS (Network Attached Storage) command centre (Locker, A 2021). There is a huge variety of what can be developed with an RPi, and as innovation and development allows the inclusion of higher powered but low-cost CPU’s and other associated hardware, further possibilities will be realised.  </p>
                      <p>The development of the RPi and its support network has also made it feasible to use RPi’s for industrial use in areas such as automation, robotics, and other embedded applications. This has been achieved though the development of the RPi Compute Module which enables rapid prototyping and production of IoT imbedded commercial products (Hallsten Innovations 2021).  <p/>

                      <h4>What is the likely impact of RPI Development? </h4>
                      <p>The RPi is also being used in developing countries where the lack of appropriate educational facilities and infrastructure are some of the leading causes for low education and poverty. The lack of support for computer science education was a problem identified by MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte who with the help of the United Nations Development Program initiated the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. However, this program failed to reach its objective of mass distribution of low-cost laptops to developing countries due to rising costs and other reasons (Shah, N 2020). With the same goal in mind, the RPi was developed with simplicity and low cost being its key features and weighing only 45 grams per unit helped reduce the financial and logistical constraints for developing countries to access technological infrastructure. Additionally, the computer facilitated an easily transported electronic library for providing education in many subject areas (Neupane, S 2015).</p>
                      <h4>What is likely to change?</h4>
                      <p>Increasing performance and falling costs and sizing of hardware links directly with RPi’s success as a small computer. The RPI will also facilitate further interest in IoT embedded systems driven by the need to understand and automate aspects of human interaction with their surroundings such as Smart Homes and Smart Appliances. The reduction in hardware size while increasing capability is the precursor of the future development of nano computers. This will accelerate the inclusion of IoT into many aspects of life.</p>

                      <h4>Will this create or make jobs or technologies redundant?</h4>
                      <p>The RPi’s low cost and ease of use has increased student interest in programming which is evident in over 30 million boards being sold and is also seen in the increase of other manufactures producing similar small computing single boards (Tung, L 2019). The RPi also filled a gap in computers appropriate for beginners to learn coding on because computers today are predominately bought as complex consumer items rather than coding machines, whereas in 80’s, home computers were simple enough to learn programming on by copying codes printed in computer magazines which inevitably required the user to debug and therefore learned programming out of necessity (Two-bit history 2021). </p>

                      <h4>How will I be affected in my daily life?</h4>
                      <p>I was exposed to computers since the early 1980’s with a steady stream of IBM PC’s using intel 8088 microprocessors and onwards and learned some programming by copying games out of computer magazines in Basic and debugged exactly as what was written earlier so I can appreciate the simplicity of the RPI. I hope my daughter can enjoy the simplicity of these small computers and gain an appreciation for IT. I also expect that with the addition of microcomputers and embedded IoT systems into an increasing number of everyday items the efficiency of common tasks will be increased through the minimisation of human involvement. The RPi is still mainly focused on students and enthusiasts, however the growth of RPi for industrial applications may also see it play a role in the lives of friends and family. Small computers are already part of their lives in areas such as monitoring consumer good supply chains, monitoring of buildings and homes, home network devices and TV’s and in processes used in manufacturing consumer goods.</p>

              <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
                <p>By Ben Vaka'uta</p>
                <h4>What is an autonomous vehicle also known as self-driving vehicles?</h4>
                <p>For those of us old enough to watch the Knight Rider TV show series in the mid to late 80s. K.I.T.T was the unrestructured black self-driving and talking Pontiac Firebird Trans Am car that was the coolest car we ever seen on TV.  When I think autonomous vehicle, I pictured K.I.T.T from the Knight Rider tv show. The fantasy from that age group has started to materialize in vehicle technology like the Tesla model S, X, 3 and Y. According to Tesla, their vehicle hardware is equipped with autonomous driving or as Tesla called it, auto pilot capability.</p>
                <p>Tesla is a little more advanced than other manufacturers with autonomous vehicles available on the market today.  Tesla vehicle has multiple forward cameras that covers wide, narrow, and main with range between 60 metres to 250 metres. It has rear view camera with a range of 50 metres, as well as forward side camera with a range of 80 metres.  Beside the cameras, it also has an ultrasonics sensor with range of 8 metres and Radar with range of 160 metres. It has an onboard computer to process all these data and enable the car to become an autonomous vehicle. With this hardware, Tesla offer autosteer+, this is where the vehicle can navigate on road with complex lane, change lane etc.  It has smart summon, where a Telsa owner to recall the Tesla car from a parking lot etc. (Tesla, 2021).  </p>
                  <p>Other car manufacturer like Nissan and GM use lane departure warning systems on their current vehicles available on the market but are still behind Tesla by a few years. With Nissan some of the features that offer in the direction of autonomous vehicles include lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, rear automatic braking when backing up, blind spot warning and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. (Brauer, Karl, 2021). However, with all these advancements in autonomous vehicle, there are roadblocks to the development of autonomous vehicle.  </p>
                    <p>According to IEEE, there are three roadblocks, the first roadblock is data privacy concern, the data processed and recorded by the vehicle computer include, how fast the vehicle is travelling on the road compare to the speed limit, the attentiveness of the driver to the road, is the vehicle operated in an aggressive or normal manner, etc. If this information is shared with the driver’s insurance carrier this could impact their insurance premium either in a positive or negative way. This information could potentially be used in court to prosecute the driver if they have broken the law or were involved in an accident.  The second roadblock is lack of Intelligent Infrastructure, not all roads are constructed equally. Some roads might not have the proper signage to allow the vehicle to identify the road speed limit, special condition for the road like a lane merging, intersection etc. Road could be fitted with sensors to provide road conditions to the vehicles travelling on that road, like how wet the road is and other conditions that would assist the autonomous vehicle with keeping the car and passengers safe on the road. The third roadblock is lack of standards. Tesla is developing their own hardware and software for autonomous driving, GM, Nissan, and others are developing their own inhouse hardware and software to progress their individual autonomous vehicle program.  These vehicle manufactures are not working together to create a standard. (IEEE Innovation at work 2021). Not only that, but each country also has its own law where autonomous vehicle manufactures must adhere to when applying for license to sell and allow their autonomous vehicle to operate on the country public roads and highways. What is clear is that most of the world largest car manufacturers are developing technologies to enable their vehicle models to become fully autonomous in the near future. It is a race to have a vehicle available on the market with full autonomous driving capability, however these manufacturers have not agreed on an industry standard and it seems that everyone is pushing their own proprietary solution. </p>
                    <h4>What is the impact of autonomous vehicles?</h4>
                      <p>Employment in transportation sectors, taxi drivers, delivery drivers, truck drivers, forklift driver have a grim future with securing long-term employment thanks to the advancement in autonomous vehicles. They will find in the near future that taxi, uber and FedEx delivery to name a few no longer require a human driver. Car dealership main find that people will no longer require to own a vehicle 24hrs a day 7 days a week because they can summon a vehicle to pick them up and take them from A to B reducing maintenance cost, capital cost for purchasing the vehicle outright, requiring a space to park the vehicle etc. When the utilization cost of personal transportation is affordable to the mass, it will open up other opportunities like elderlies/senior citizens can enjoy sightseeing on a private ride on mountain side, beach and other tourist hotspots from the privacy of an autonomous car. This is what the autonomous industry technology companies are aiming for like start up Cruise LLC which this week got the backing from the like of Microsoft and GM. (Welch, David 2021).    </p>
                      <p>There will be new job creations to maintain these new autonomous vehicles.  There will be new industry to recycle these vehicles at the end of its lifecycle for example recycle batteries. Vehicle manufacturer like Renault is planning ways to optimized recycling of these old batteries from Autonomous vehicles. (Engineerlive, 2021). This will contribute to reducing the pollution on the environment and old hardware are not being recycled and instead send to the land fill. Jobs that might post danger to a human driver or operator, like operating heavy machineries on a cliff or mountain can be accomplished by autonomous vehicle.  Its profitable businesses as autonomous vehicles can operate 24hrs a day, where human drivers need break. </p>
                      <h4>Impact of autonomous vehicles on me?</h4>
                      <p> I will have more time to do other things like enjoying the road, sightseeing then having to focus on operating the vehicle when travelling to outer states and long-distance trips. I might not have to own the vehicle outright. I can subscribe to a car share subscription where the car picks me up when I need a transportation and drop me off when I am done. I can go to places where it is difficult to find parking or where parking is expensive because there is no extra cost due to the vehicle not having to park there and wait for me.  I suspect that this will be cheaper option then having to purchase a car outright, pay for insurance, maintenance, and a place to store the vehicle when not in use. I will not need a driver license, so when I get older it will not inhibit me from making private trip to the beach, park etc.  There should be less vehicles on the road and because the vehicle is autonomous it will be more efficient in finding the optimum route to my destination and higher safety standard then human driving. With less vehicles on the road also mean less pollution to the environment and I get to enjoy fresh air around me.  According to Thales group, autonomous vehicle will reduce harmful emissions by 60%, 90% reduction in traffic deaths, increase lane capacity by 500%, reduce travel time by 40%, consumer save heaps of money, eliminate stop and go traffic by 100% and improve fuel economy by 10%. (Thales Group 2017).  Future looks bright with autonomous vehicle development. </p>

                <h3>Robots</h3>
                <p>By Jayden Warrell</p>
                <h3>Defining state of the art</h3>
                  <p>Robots are a broad technology and could be defined as programmable machinery which can carry out tasks autonomously or semi-autonomous (CSstanford edu 2020). The earliest digitally programmable robot was to be invented in 1954, although the first model was not industrialized until the mid-60’s (Mind project 2011). They consist of four main components being a body, controller, sensors, and actuators such as pistons or motors. The controller acts as a device which can be programmed with instructions, the sensor detects the surroundings, the actuator receives signals to allow for movement, and the body simply encases materials and moulds parts. These machines are designed to help humans achieve greater accomplishments and their typical purpose is to perform tasks that can simulate human efficiency. Since 2010 the global stock deployed in industries has more than doubled (oxford economics 2020). Some explanation for this development is cost efficiency, enhancements in productivity, and the reduced requirement for human manual labour. </p>
                  <p>Today there are around 2.7 million robots installed in industries across the world (world robotics 2020). This is due to the effectiveness in sectors such as agriculture, health care, military but mostly manufacturing. Some of the specific jobs they carry out within these sectors include constructing automotive instruments in assembly lines, conveying communication, aiding surgeons to perform surgical operations, or emulating human locomotion to supply prosthetic limbs. Robots can even outperform humans in persistency and accuracy. It comes as no surprise that companies around the world want to invest in the technology for industrial use. It is estimated that by 2030 around 20 million jobs will be replaced by robots in the global manufacturing industry alone (oxford economics 2020). </p>
                  <p>In current times there are many plans to deliver future developments in robots that will make an impact in the years to come. New robot models are being suggested that will integrate advancements in data analysis and cloud technology. This could reduce the demand for individual programming and link robots to communicate through sensors across a network. Analyst are predicting a high marketing trend for this type of model as it will implement higher networking capability and allow robots to work more collectively (IFR 2020). Another advancement that is gaining traction, is to apply artificial intelligence at the core of industrial robots. AI assimilated robots are expected to drive market growth 15% by 2027(Robotics Tomorrow 2010-2021). Rather than supplementing current versions with AI components, the innovation is to redesign robots that revolve around artificial intelligence. The assimilation would grant robots the ability to be receptive and adapt to changing conditions more independently in the workforce. Therefore, delivering greater autonomy to robots in general due to AI systems guiding the functions. This requires completely new designs, but the advantages could eliminate factors such as human error and achieve greater speed or efficiency. It becomes a clear trend that advancements in other technology such as machine learning, AI, and cloud networking have the potential to improve robots. </p>
                  <h3>Likely Impact</h3>
                  <p>Robots have become valuable assets to society but have caused a significant societal shift in the process. They are improving quality of production but also coincidentally drive a competition to employment. It is estimated that adding one robot to any geological location will reduce employment in that area by six workers (MITsloanschool 2020). The main industries effected by this scenario would be mining, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and mostly the manufacturing-automotive sector (robodDKinc 2020). It is worth noting the main jobs that will be affected are tedious, hazardous, or unwanted tasks. This therefore reduces risk of injury and poor job satisfaction. This is because the initiative of combining technology to the workforce is not to replace humans in their jobs, but to make practices safer and more practical. Nonetheless, jobs that are hazardous, simply automated, or unskilled could become entirely redundant. Contrary to replacing these jobs, they are also generating new roles that did not previously exist. This will change industries as it prompts the demand for new jobs entirely, that require skilled workers instead of unskilled labour (investopedia2020). Some of the work likely to be generated would revolve around collaborating with robots and designing the implementation of robots into the workforce. This could particularly create new roles such as robotics managers or artificial intelligence teachers (sam-solution1993-2021). This might also result in new industries being generated, including work to design and use automation. </p>

                  <h3>Effect on my daily life</h3>
                  <p>Robots are increasingly effecting society as they progress and begin to be met in a variety of day-to-day scenarios. Firstly, the impact will reduce the need for my friends to complete hazardous and hard manual labour jobs. Also, my perception of the industry will change heavily as it seems more jobs are highly susceptible to automation such as occupations that include predictable physical work, data processing and data collection (Mckinseyreport1996-2021). I consider this effecting my family a lot since I have relatives in mining who insist robots are already being scheduled to underground operations. This is arguably affecting their livelihoods to an extent already. I also see the use of minor non-advanced cleaning robots being used in certain households and elegant businesses regularly. When I was a child seeing these models would not be common. Considering this technology is partially new on a grand scale, I will have the privilege to perceive the changes this type of technology will make to entertainment and business long term.</p>

                  <h3>Network security</h3>
                  <p>by Jason Halse</p>
                    <p>Network security is a set of rules and structures designed to protect the integrity, hardware and software. All companies and/or organizations need some level of network security in todays’ landscape to protect themselves against the ever growing and changing threats that are out there.  </p>
                    <p>There are many different tools that we can use to help improve our network security some of these include.  </p>
                  <ul class="keySkills">
          <li>Antivirus programs. (Norton, McAfee, Avast). These programs detect viruses and hopefully remove them before they infect your computer.</li>
          <li>Firewalls. This can be either software or hardware. It puts up a barrier between the computer which is on a trusted network and untrusted networks allowing the user to allow or block incoming traffic. </li>
          <li>VPN. Also known as a Virtual Private Network the role of a VPN is to encrypt your connection to the internet which makes it harder to trace and track. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>One of the emerging technologies coming out of the network security sector and oner that has garnered my interest is VDN or Virtual Dispersive Networking. So, what this basically does is disperse the information being sent across multiple data streams with inly the end user receiving 100% of the data sent. This means hackers will only get small chunks of the data making it almost useless. This is particularly useful against MiM attacks (Man in the Middle).  </p>
          <p>This will not so much impact the wider community as the way in we would send data from a user point of view would not change. This would impact the security threats i.e., hackers. As the data in its entirety would be harder to obtain therefore the hackers would have to come up with new ways to obtain data. I am hoping this becomes a more mainstream way of sending data both for the professionals and for the general public. In sending data this way our privacy will be more protected as data farmers would only be able to get bits and pieces of our personal data. As yet this will not affect me or my family in our daily lives as this is not a mainstream way of sending data.  </p>

            <h1>Project Ideas - Automated Greenhouse</h1>
            <h1>Monitoring microclimate conditions to increase growth</h1>
            </div>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p> The group project is an automated climate control attachment that can be fitted to small commercially available greenhouses that are approximately 1m x 1m x 1.5m and costing between $30 - $60 at Bunnings and similar big box hardware warehouse.
                The automated control unit is driven by an Arduino microcontroller and contains temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content sensors. These sensors relay information inside the unit to the Arduino which then controls an inlet fan and a water source to maintain predetermined conditions by the user.
                The device is aimed at the gardening enthusiast with the goal to simplify plant care though automation and to provide an ideal growth environment for potted plants. It is simple, low cost, and is portable and lightweight for ease of positioning around the garden or balcony.</p>
              <br>
              <img src="greenhouse 1.png" alt="greenhouse as supplied"/>
              <p>Low cost greenhouse as supplied from Bunnings

              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>The current global pandemic has obligated people to stay at home more and many have turned to hobbies and other housebound activities for entertainment. This is evident with increased revenues from large retailers of household and gardening supplies in Australia  and the booming plant bazaars, nurseries and increases in online sellers throughout Bangkok. The increase in gardening popularity is not only from those with a garden but also from apartment dwellers growing plants indoor or on the balcony. The most popular plants during this period are ornamental due to their beauty and value. These types of plants require extra care to maintain optimal leaf, shoot and root growth with the slightest deviation ruining the appearance of the decorative foliage.
              The automation of garden care processes is possible using inexpensive sensors, microcontrollers and other simple hardware. This allows conditions inside the greenhouse to be monitored and maintained for the users and their plants benefit from the optimal conditions it provides.  </p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Many plants species are grown as a hobby because of their beauty, popularity, and rarity. This rarity is due to not being native to the local environment and are either sourced from other parts of the country or overseas. The problem with growing these types of plants is that local environmental conditions may not be optimal for their growth. Therefore, increased maintenance is required to maintain plant health and a visually appealing foliage.
                  Additionally, free space around the home may be subjected to extremes of sunlight or shade that are unfavourable for growing plants. This is where a controlled environment offered by an automated greenhouse can be a solution. It can increase the range of plant species that can be grown in the local environment and is achieved by tailoring the conditions in the greenhouse specifically to the plant’s requirements. Additionally, potted plants can be cycled through the greenhouse as a nurturing boost before being placed back into areas where they can have maximum viewing pleasure.</p>
                <p>The focus of the project is not on the overall greenhouse structure due to a large variety of small, cheap, and portable versions already available on the marked. The projects focus is to provide an additional unit that can be attached to the front of a prebought greenhouse with simple modifications, connected to a power and water source, and create a stable environment tailored to the user’s requirements.
                  Through automation, the greenhouse will measure the greenhouse conditions and apply resources as required to maintain a predetermined condition. Maintaining soil moisture content is achieved by timing the opening a sprinkler in the early morning or evening as required to increase moisture but not humidity. Humidity is controlled by opening a misting spray during the warmer parts of the day or turning on a ventilation fan. Temperature is controlled by operating a heating lamp or fan, and lighting is controlled by manipulating a shade blind. Soil nutrient content could also be available however the sensor would have to be manually moved from pot to pot. For simplicity, these features can be added or removed as components.  </p>
                  <p>The automation of these processes also allows for the capacity to capture data to SD card or transmit data via WIFI which enables the user to begin with a benchmark and then experiment with different greenhouse conditions to find optimal growth. This information could also be shared with other users of similar systems and open discussions related to best practice or find solutions to remedy problems. Further expansions could be related to web based, monitoring, control, and forum discussion. While the options for variations to parameters are nearly endless, it could include pre-installed settings allowing it for plug and play which would make it more commercially appealing. Condition settings could also be manipulated by enthusiasts to achieve a better outcome or grow a larger variety of species. </p>

                  <h3>Tools & Tech</h3>
                    <p>The automated greenhouse is based on inexpensive kit form greenhouses available at most big box hardware outlets or online retailers. The size is based on the popular 1m x 1m x 1.5 model and could be scaled up slightly to accommodate larger models available such as 1.50m x 1.50m x 1.95m, however retaining a small footprint and portability is one of the key objectives.
                      To monitor the conditions inside the greenhouse, readily available low-cost sensors will be used to measure soil moisture content, humidity, and temperature. (Appendix 1). The sensor data will be input to an Arduino which will then output signals to switch relays which will operate water pumps, water solenoid valves, fan, and a heating lamp. The unit is triangular shaped and is designed to fit into the gable on the front of the greenhouse. This will contain the microcontroller, sensors and relays and the conditions inside will be displayed on the LCD at the front. The soil sensor will be placed in a pot of the user’s choice and misting sprays attached to the top of the greenhouse by the user. Power is supplied by a normal power point, however it could also be adapted to use a battery and solar cell.
                      The unit can be broken down into several components and it is possible to add each component in stages as the user desires. This is simply done by attaching the connectors from the new sensor or other device to the Arduino and updating the firmware via PC.
                      WIFI connectivity is also a planned feature with the addition of the low cost ESP8266 WIFI Module and opens many possibilities for user interaction.</p>

                    <h3>Skills required</h3>
                      <p>The bare greenhouse is a commercially available unit that requires little skill to assemble. The automation module contains the integration of several component projects aimed at IT students and IT enthusiasts. The Arduino and associated sensors and components are available online for little cost.  The Arduino uses C++ programming and while our group lacks the required experience, these products are aimed at beginners and there is a large amount of information available online for free. The project will require basic electronics knowledge for hardware setup to interface the sensor inputs with the Arduino and coding for Arduino to send and receive signals from sensors to servos and switches. An anticipated issue is the soil moisture content will be sensing just one pot in the greenhouse and watering will be based on that one input and may not be a representative of the condition of other pots. It is proposed that the automation unit will be developed in stages as the required competencies are attained.</p>

                      <h3>Outcome</h3>
                        <p>The outcome of a successful project would be a marketable product that could be produced relatively cheaply and allow small hobby gardens to be set up in a variety of small spaces. It could also benefit busy people as it may reduce time needed to maintain a small garden. Additionally, the unit would provide data that is not able to be obtained with normal hands on gardening. The data capture aspect could also help form a gardening community that was interested in a more structured approach that was results driven through benchmarking and measurable improvements. There is also the possibility that it could be scaled to suit much larger applications. </p>

                <h1>Project Discription</h1>
                <h1>Joes automated internet connected greenhouse module</h1>
                </div>
              <div class="sectionContent">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <h3>Topic</h3>
                  <p>The project proposes an automation module that can be easily fitted to a store-bought greenhouse kit. These greenhouses are small, lightweight, cheap, available at big box hardware stores or online markets and are quick and easy to assemble.  </p>
                  <p>The automation module is simply attached to the front of the greenhouse and connected to the internet. The core of the automation module is an Arduino based microcontroller. These are low cost, easily sourced components that are the core of a variety of automation components and have IoT connectivity. They are easily programmed and have a vast amount of development information available. </p>
                  <p>The overall project objective is to capture a proportion of the booming home gardening market. It is seen that apart from electronics hobby “maker” areas, there is little available in low-cost automated growing solutions. This could take two directions, either a locked down “plug and play” style consumer product, or a kit-based product which can be enjoyed by tech enthusiasts who like to “think outside of the box” through its customisability. By including the IoT component, this brings the capability of social media interaction between users who can discuss their customised settings and plant growth success. This would also be a valuable data source for further product development through the analysis of user feedback. Additionally, a larger module suitable for commercial growing is a possibility. </p>
                  <h3>Motivation</h3>
                  <p>The inclusion of internet connectivity into ordinary home products and appliances is growing rapidly as people enjoy the convenience of integrating and automating mundane tasks with their smart phones. This frees up available time to pursue other interests. Interest in home gardening has grown since the pandemic lockdown has forced more people to remain at home. This presents the opportunity to combine home automation and gardening.   </p>
                  <p>On a large agricultural scale, automation has been available for some time already, however, it is costly and outside of the scope of consumer needs. By taking advantage of low-cost and mass produced electrical components such as microcontrollers, sensors and WIFI adapters, it is possible to develop an internet connected automated greenhouse aimed at consumers using both software and hardware resources. With the boom in social media, there is also potential for this aspect to be included facilitating community discussion around the products operation and more importantly plant growth success photos and stories.  </p>
                  <p> While the team has little experience with this technology, the vast number of resources available for this type of project allows group members to easily increase their knowledge base during product development leading a successful outcome of an interesting product to showcase.</p>
                  <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
                  <p>On the competitive landscape, there are large scale commercial greenhouses available which require design and assembly by qualified installers. This is a different market and not seen as a competitor at this stage, however, future project expansion could see this market as a potential opportunity for entry. On the other end of the scale, consumer based automated greenhouses kits are aimed at DIY and engineering students. These small kits are designed to be assembled and programmed by the user and offer minimal features such as watering a single small pot on a table. An example is simple NodeMCU based watering kit available from Superkitz (Automatic Watering System IoT using Soil Moisture Sensor NodeMCU(ESP8266) DIY Kit 2020).  In between these two extremes there is plenty of DIY activity designing and building small scale automated greenhouse projects undertaken by more skilled IT and electronics enthusiasts.  These types of projects require users to develop their skills to set up and use the Arduino IDE programming interface as well as electronics assembly and soldering techniques. There is a steep learning curve when fault finding, and troubleshooting is required. For the complete novice, this project may take several weekends to complete and may not have a successful outcome. The key difference with the automation module that the group has developed is that it will be pre-assembled and programmed to facilitate a plug and play system and therefore filling the gap in affordable consumer grade greenhouse automation. Additionally, by using hardware acquired from the same source as DIY enthusiasts, costs can be kept low allowing the product to be aimed at entry level gardeners. </p>
                  <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
                  <h3>Project Aim</h3>
                  <p>The aim of the project is to provide an attachment for a greenhouse that uses information technology to transform it into an automated environment that is optimal for plant growth and yield. This will benefit the user by reducing the time requirements for plant maintenance. By using low-cost components and a friendly user interface it will be affordable and easy for everyone to use. This will fill the gap in the market for an automated gardening environment that is aimed at people with busy lives but still have an interest in growing their own beautiful plants. It is believed that due to the projects modular design, it will be easily scaled to various sizes of greenhouses and thus creating multiple revenue streams in not only consumer grade products but also commercial grade products in the future. Funding requirements for this project will be low due to the low-cost nature of the hardware resources and small employee headcount. Anticipated completion time for a fully working prototype is 15 weeks.</p>
                  <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                  <p>To reach the objective of completing the development of the automated greenhouse module, goals reflect the individual stages that must be completed. Each stages progression requires knowledge that must be built upon from previous stages. This allows the project to have tangible functionality in the early stages and the later stages increasing functionality but not as significantly important to demonstrate a working prototype.</p>
                  <h3>Choice of microcontroller</h3>
                  <p>The microcontroller is the “the heart of the project” and its correct selection is the highest priority for project success. This goal is to identify the microcontroller that offers the best functionality and is based on project requirements and ease of integration. There are a large variety of microcontrollers available with different functionality and their own market segments. Commercial grade micro controllers including Cypress Semiconductor, Infineon, Maxim Integrated, Panasonic and Texas Instruments are often integrated into commercial goods however these require a greater understanding and knowledge of their systems. Enthusiast grade microcontroller boards such as Arduino and the NodeMCU etc include commercial grade microcontrollers but also offer a more user-friendly physical interface for IO connectivity as well as a larger availability of information resource. Microcomputers such as the Raspberry Pi could also be used and could possibly increase functionality more than a microcontroller.</p>
                    <h3>Choice of required automation functionality</h3>
                  <p>This goal is to research and develop the products features based on customer wants and the availability of reasonably priced sensors and their ease of implementation that can help provide solutions. There is a huge amount of sensors available on the market and it is tempting to cram as many as possible to have a large features list, however this may result in a higher unit cost and unwanted features. There are also reliability issues with increasing circuit complexity. However, it is possible that individual sensor kits and firmware upgrades could be included in the future to increase product customisation and revenue flows. At the completion of this goal, the greenhouse will be automated and a proved concept.</p>
                  <h3>IoT connectivity. </h3>
                  <p>This goal is further down the list of priorities. It involves transmitting the modules sensors data to a 3rd party cloud service provider and integrated with their smart phone application. It is a feature that enhances its competitive advantage and is in line with current trends to automate ordinary tasks. However, this feature adds complexity, is dependent on an internet connection and its success and reliability is outsourced to an external vendor which ads a dimension of risk.</p>
                  <h3>Dedicated website</h3>
                  <p>This is the final goal for this project phase, however additional goals will most likely be added in the future as the project is more successful. The purpose of this goal is to remove the risk of the products functionality from the external cloud service provider and develop an in-house website and smartphone applications for IoT connectivity. This also allows user interface customisations and additional features not available in the 3rd party application releasing competitive advantages while being able to mitigate risk.</p>
                    <h3>Plans and Progress.</h3>
                  <p>The project is to develop a closed loop automation process that could be adapted to the greenhouse through the development of hardware and software resources. This will be achieved by using a microcontroller that can be programmed using the Arduino language due to its relative simplicity as it is aimed at students and IT enthusiasts. Once developed into a working prototype, the model can then be ruggedised to protect the electronics from shock, vibration and moisture inclusion and tested inside the greenhouse. It is also added that the project group had little to no experience with programming microcontrollers and assembling electrical componentry and it will be necessary to develop these skills as the project progresses.</p>
                  <p>The project was envisioned by one group member whose wife was a keen gardener and had purchased several small cheap greenhouse kits used grow various Monstera, Philodendron and Alocasia plant species at their home in Bangkok. The automation aspect was inspired by a simple unrelated project testing an Arduino board, temperature and humidity sensor and LCD display which was placed inside a greenhouse. This revealed that the humidity inside the greenhouse was exceeding 95% which was the maximum value of the sensor. Research was then conducted to find the optimal humidity range for the species being grown which was found to be between 60% to 80%. The question was then poised. How could a system be developed that could control the humidity to an optimal level? Additionally, what other environmental factors could be controlled inside the greenhouse that could provide optimal conditions to increase plant growth and yield. </p>
                  <p>Close to this group members house in Bangkok is large electronics componentry market named “Ban Mo” which has hundreds of stores selling electronic components manufactured locally in Thailand and imported from China. This market has many shops offering repair services for any electrical device, some with dedicated storefronts and others operating out of a pushcart parked on the side of the road. Due to Thailand’s large scale manufacturing industries, there is a large demand for componentry and skilled electronics technicians and therefore, students and others looking at developing electrical prototypes come to Ban Mo for supplies. Our group member often came here browsing the electronics bazaar and trawled through the shops looking at different components, envisioning how they could be applied to projects.</p>
                    <p>To develop a plan for the automation of the greenhouse, factors that contributed to plant growth would need to be analysed and determined if they could be controlled and how. The temperature and humidity could be controlled by a fan or a heating lamp. A shop selling Arduino components also had sensors that measured soil moisture content and low powered relays suitable for the project. Initial testing of individual sensors was done by copying code from sources available on the internet to attempt to understand their workings. The next question was how to combine the code for the temperature sensor and the soil moisture sensor? Experimentation was hindered by two burned out DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors and one burned out LM35 temperature sensor. Up to this point, learning to program the Arduino was a cut and paste affair without any real understanding. It became apparent that the reasoning behind the code would have to be learned before the project could continue.</p>
                      <p>The basic model was pulled apart, code wiped, and an Arduino programming tutorial was sought to start learning from the beginning. A YouTube tutorial series by Paul McWhorter called New Arduino Tutorials (McWhorter 2019) was found. It contains 68 episodes at roughly 30 minutes each and covered most sensors and components contained in the Arduino Starters Kit already at hand. While a lot of these components would be unrelated to the greenhouse project, the theory behind their use and associated programming would become part of the required knowledge base for fault finding later in the project.</p>
                        <p>While the Arduino Uni microcontroller was tied up with the YouTube tutorial series learning projects, a second Arduino Nano microcontroller was obtained to continue with the greenhouse project. This time the features of the Arduino hardware and programming in the Arduino IDE interface was better understood. A simple program was written to run the DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor as well as a resistive soil moisture sensor with the output data displayed on the Arduino IDE serial monitor on the computer. This was mostly successful, however further research was required to convert the analogue reading from the soil sensor to a percentage. This research also revealed that the resistive soil sensor has a particularly short life span due to the nature of its construction. The operation of this sensor is relatively simple. The Arduino sends 5v to the sensor which operates as a variable resistor with the more “wet” the soil is, the better it conducts electricity, and the Arduino reads the sensors output voltage. However, the resistance between the two probes is also prone to corrosion due to the 5v DC running between them limiting its service life. The sensors readings can also be affected by nutrient levels and fertilisers in the soil changing the soil’s resistive properties. </p>
                          <p>A capacitive sensor was obtained and swapping out the resistive soil sensor. The advantage of the capacitive soil sensor was its corrosion resistant materials, and no DC corrosion issues due to the capacitive nature of its operation. It was also giving more accurate readings. However, it was found that the sensors reading can be manipulated by compacting the soil around the sensor and it also had the tendency to stop working after a period and then start working again unexplainably. The resistive sensor never displayed this problem. A second capacitive soil sensor was obtained, and the issues persisted. The code for this sensor was also checked against code available online with no apparent differences. This could be due to the sensors cheap price and low-grade construction. The issue would remain throughout the project and to alleviate this problem it is possible to purchase a higher quality sensor in the future.</p>
                            <p>The next step was adding the two relays that would operate the fan and the water pump. Relay one is assigned to the operation of the 12cm x 12cm 5v computer fan. The signal from the humidity sensor is operating the relay through the “if /else” command. The setpoint to switch the fan relay on is at 70% humidity and below 70% the relay switches off. This proved quite easy to code and works well. Relay number 2 was assigned to the water pump and operated similarly to the fan relay setup, the pump relay switches on at below 50% moisture content in the soil and switches off above 50%. This also worked well however the pump had not yet been obtained so results were based only on the switching of the relay when the sensor was placed in a glass of water.</p>
                              <p>The prototype was a working concept up to this point and relatively easy to implement. It would have been possible to end development here and move the project from breadboard to PCB and into a functioning greenhouse, however, the possibility of integrating IoT was intriguing. The group researched possible IoT modules to integrate into the project. The ESP8266 module was extensively documented online so one was obtained through an online market without sufficient research into project suitability. What arrived was a NodeMCU module which upon further investigation was a microcontroller with an integrated 8266 WIFI microchip which was compatible with the Arduino programming language. As we were looking to integrate a standalone WIFI module into the Arduino circuit, the NodeMCU was put in a drawer and a simpler ESP-01 WIFI module was obtained. </p>
                                <p>The greenhouse project was put on hold for a week after the completion of assignment 2. The NodeMCU was further investigated for another side project for a high-pressure fogging spray system for the garden. With knowledge gained from the greenhouse controller project, a simple program was written to include a DHT11 temperature sensor and relay. Following instructions found online written by Manoranjan (2018), it was connected to the BLYNK cloud service provider, placed inside the greenhouse for 3 days powered by a mobile phone power bank. It was simple to set up and monitor the greenhouse over the BLYNK application and the relay could be actuated over the internet by an icon on the app. The NodeMCU was connected to the gardening fog system with the relay actuating the 24v pump and was successfully operating via the cloud network. The temperature and humidity sensor also provided additional information that was displayed on the BLYNK application on a smartphone.</p>
                                  <p>The ease at setting up IoT integration with the garden fogging system using the NodeMCU module and the BLYNK cloud brought the greenhouse project to a crossroad.  Does the project use the existing Arduino nano circuit and try to integrate the ESP-01 or rebuild the system around the NodeMCU module? The group was tasked with finding ways to integrate the ESP-01 WIFI module with the Arduino Nano and a decision-making framework with timeframe was developed to choose the best option. </p>
                                  <p>After a day of research, it was found that the ESP-01 was more difficult to implement than the NodeMCU and subsequently dropped and the project was redesigned around the new microprocessor. However, this was not as straight forward as implementing the fogging system as there were more sensors, relays as well as the circuits voltage changed from 5v to 3.3 volts due to the NodeMCU requirements which complicated the 5v relay circuit. This involved a circuit redesign with the addition of a LM317 voltage step down from 12v supply to 5v to drive the relays and the microcontroller, however this was later swapped out to a LM2596 voltage step down due to heat issues. It is also added that when this new voltage step down was added, the 12v positive and ground wires were accidently reversed and the NodeMCU was burn out. A new NodeMCU was obtained, and the project continued.</p>
                                  <p>On the programming side, there was a significant learning curve due to the integration of the BLYNK cloud server. While both microcontrollers use the Arduino language, the change to cloud integration was complex due to the high frequency of data generated by the loop cycle traditionally used in Arduino programming. After extensive research, it was found that the code normally contained in the loop cycle, such as the “if” and “else” statements, needed to be removed and placed in a separately timed “send sensor” loop cycle to avoid spamming the cloud resulting in a service disconnect. Another problem encountered was integrating the 16x2 I2c LCD with the redesigned power circuit where a wiring error was made and the I2C module was burnt out. A new and larger 20 x 4 I2C LCD module was obtained and proved to be more visually appealing.</p>
                                  <p>The prototype was ready to be transferred from breadboard to stripboard and connections soldered in place to provide a more rugged platform that could be mounted inside a sealed box and placed into the greenhouse. The fogging system side project provided many valuable learnings which were applied to the greenhouse project, one of which was planning the circuit on an online circuit diagram drawing application such as is available on circuit-diagram.org or Fritzing.org. By redrawing the circuit, it allowed for a deeper understanding of the wiring process allowing for revisions and optimisations before physical construction began. This was particularly beneficial when dealing with components requiring different voltages and identified some design errors. The project was rebuilt onto a PCB stripboard and bench tested once again. A 5v pump was sourced, attached to its designated relay and a problem was found. When the pump was switched on, it created interference with the relays signal line and the microcontroller froze. Without the pump attached, the relay functioned as required. Several methods were tried to rectify the problem such as isolating the relays power source, placing a capacitor across the pump, trying a new pump, and making another simple circuit containing only an Arduino, relay, and pump, however these all resulted in the both the Arduino and the NodeMCU shutting down. This was perplexing as the fogging system worked flawlessly with a high output 24v pump connected similarly and yet this smaller 5v hobby grade pump was causing issues. This proved to be a roadblock in the project that could not be solved within the allocated time. The automated IoT greenhouse was assembled, and the water pump was omitted for now. It is thought that further electrical circuitry knowledge is required to solve this signal interference problem.</p>
                                    <h3>Roles.</h3>
                                  <p>Ilya played many roles during the project such as the product owner. He had the vision of the greenhouse project and the passion for its result. This was due to his families gardening interests at home and his interest in microcontrollers and automation. He also was the technical lead for the development team though planning work around the project requirements of customer needs. </p>
                                  <p>Jason had the technical lead role for hardware circuitry design and troubleshooting as he was the subject matter expert in this field. </p>
                                  <p>All group members were project sponsors providing their own budgeting and financial support for their individual deliverable such as software licences and electronic componentry. </p>
                                  <p>Group members also shared software and hardware development responsibilities, through conducting individual research on component advantages and disadvantages and their selection processes as well as providing blocks of code for individual components.</p>
                                <p>The user interface design was a collaboration between team members through the contribution of ideas and the share of workload. This was particularly evident for the promotional media component of the project. </p>
                                <p>Stakeholder management and communication was conducted by all team members though collaborative report writing.</p>

                                <h3>Scope and Limits.</h3>
                              <p>The projects' goal is to bring an affordable automated greenhouse to the booming home improvement consumer market that will allow plants to grow and thrive through the provision of an optimal growing environment. This will be achieved using readily available microprocessors and other components and skills able to be learned through freely available online learning materials. The deliverables included in this project scope includes a product that displays temperature, humidity, and soil moisture content on an LCD display located on the product as well as on a connected smartphone or tablet via the BLYNK application. It will also maintain humidity and soil moisture content below adjustable setpoints facilitated by the switching of a single fan and a water pump. Data from these readings is recorded on the BLYNK cloud and can be viewed online or downloaded in CSV format for further analysis by the user. </p>
                              <p>As the project has progressed, it has become apparent that many additional features could be implemented. These include the development of a native website which can be accessed from a computer to analyse data and integrated with a social media function, the addition of an air quality measuring device or the addition of extra soil sensors, fans, and pumps. However, these are outside of the scope of the project at this stage. Additionally, the project is limited by budget constraints and therefore only low cost “hobby grade” sensors will be used at this stage. The current skill level of the project team is still under development which may affect budget and timelines; however, the necessary skills are currently being acquired. </p>
                              <p>Stakeholders in this project such as project owners and investors should see a product ready for demonstration in approximately 15 weeks due to its relative simplicity and the abundance of hardware and knowledge resources required.</p>


                              <h3>Tools and Technologies.</h3>
                            <p>As the greenhouse project is a physical object it requires both software and hardware resources. The open-source and free Arduino IDE software was used with the Arduino Uno, Nano and NodeMCU microprocessors throughout the project's development to compile and upload programs to the microcontroller. Additional USB serial port drivers were required to interface the board with the PC through a virtual COM port which are also free. Connection with the PC is through a USB cable however each board had a different USB interface requiring multiple cable throughout the project.</p>
                            <p>Additional electrical equipment required such as a 12v power supply to power the circuit, multi meter for testing, and assembly equipment such as soldering equipment, wires and cutters and a hot glue gun. These were all acquired though a local market at a minimal cost. There was also a reasonable number of sensors and modules damaged during the learning and development phase which required repurchase.</p>
                            <p>The groups experience and knowledge of the tools and technologies required for the project was limited. Jason has some electrical experience with non-Arduino microcontrollers, relays, and basic circuitry in his employment, however, overall, the groups initial skill level was low and required learning skills to overcome issues and progress through the stages of the project. This lack of knowledge was a key issue when trying to solve the pump problem. Our skills had been developed more towards programming throughout the project and fault finding a circuity design issue was above our skill set at that time.</p>
                              <p>The development of promotional media required paid access to the video producing platform Animaker, however this was not a significant cost to the group and was comparable to the cost of the electrical componentry.</p>

                            <h3>Testing.</h3>
                          <p>It was necessary to test the automation module through every step of the project such as when an additional sensor or component was added to increase functionality. This not only involved testing newly written programs but also careful checking of wiring connections. It was easy to recover from a programming error, however a wiring error usually resulted in time lost replacing a damaged component. Extensive testing was also done after major board redesigns when microcontroller types were changed. </p>
                          <p>When moving the project from breadboard to stripboard, testing of programming was mostly complete, however testing of wiring and soldering connections with a multi meter to check for possible short circuits was extensive as the project had already experienced its fair share of unintentionally fried components. This testing phase was found to be a longer process than anticipated due to lack of circuit planning and construction knowledge. When the stripboard wiring and soldering testing was completed, power could be added, and the module tested for correct function. </p>
                          <p>Throughout the development process programs were saved at various points when deemed as “working” before major changes were made so they could be rolled back to if needed. This also served as knowledge management documentation for the group. These were hosted on GitHub and locally on HDD and USB for multiple backup locations. Testing and knowledge management was also facilitated when recreating the circuit using online design platforms where errors or optimisations could be identified.</p>
                          <p>Photo documentation of wiring of the breadboard prototype as well as note taking was also made, however, as the project progressed and the programming was better understood, it was easy to read the code and understand the wiring required to suit.</p>
                          <p>Overall testing of the completed product was undertaken when the module was installed on the greenhouse and its operation was observed on the smart phone application. It was noted during this testing phase that the high and low sensor levels of the soil sensor could be better calibrated by using dry and wet soil as opposed to dunking the sensor in a glass of water during bench testing.</p>

                          <h3>Group processes and communications.</h3>
                        <p>The project group is separated by vast distances with two group members situated in Melbourne, one in Queensland and another in Thailand. This has made face to face communication not possible. However, with available internet technology and hardware such as web cams and microphones, group communication has been unimpeded.  The Microsoft Teams platform has been an invaluable base for the group's communication. A weekly group video conferencing session has been successful to facilitate collaborative discussion for project direction and task allocation to responsible members. Chat messaging has also been undertaken throughout the week when group members need to communicate. This also solves the problem of multiple time zones for the group. The Teams platform also allows for collaboration of project reporting and other associated documentation.  </p>
                        <p>Other platforms are available for group communication such as Canvas and the university email accounts, however using several avenues of communication can become confusing and important messages can be easily missed. </p>
                        <p>The use of GitHub repositories has also been important for collaborative work on the programming and website development.  </p>
                      <p>The groups process for project progression and completion has been through weekly updates of completed project deliverables by assigned task members as well as and those which are still in progress. This allows for extra resources to be applied if necessary, to bring a lagging task back in line with its desired completion date.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Many plants species are grown as a hobby because of their beauty, popularity, and rarity. This rarity is due to not being native to the local environment and are either sourced from other parts of the country or overseas. The problem with growing these types of plants is that local environmental conditions may not be optimal for their growth. Therefore, increased maintenance is required to maintain plant health and a visually appealing foliage.
                      Additionally, free space around the home may be subjected to extremes of sunlight or shade that are unfavourable for growing plants. This is where a controlled environment offered by an automated greenhouse can be a solution. It can increase the range of plant species that can be grown in the local environment and is achieved by tailoring the conditions in the greenhouse specifically to the plant’s requirements. Additionally, potted plants can be cycled through the greenhouse as a nurturing boost before being placed back into areas where they can have maximum viewing pleasure.</p>
                    <p>The focus of the project is not on the overall greenhouse structure due to a large variety of small, cheap, and portable versions already available on the marked. The projects focus is to provide an additional unit that can be attached to the front of a prebought greenhouse with simple modifications, connected to a power and water source, and create a stable environment tailored to the user’s requirements.
                      Through automation, the greenhouse will measure the greenhouse conditions and apply resources as required to maintain a predetermined condition. Maintaining soil moisture content is achieved by timing the opening a sprinkler in the early morning or evening as required to increase moisture but not humidity. Humidity is controlled by opening a misting spray during the warmer parts of the day or turning on a ventilation fan. Temperature is controlled by operating a heating lamp or fan, and lighting is controlled by manipulating a shade blind. Soil nutrient content could also be available however the sensor would have to be manually moved from pot to pot. For simplicity, these features can be added or removed as components.  </p>
                      <p>The automation of these processes also allows for the capacity to capture data to SD card or transmit data via WIFI which enables the user to begin with a benchmark and then experiment with different greenhouse conditions to find optimal growth. This information could also be shared with other users of similar systems and open discussions related to best practice or find solutions to remedy problems. Further expansions could be related to web based, monitoring, control, and forum discussion. While the options for variations to parameters are nearly endless, it could include pre-installed settings allowing it for plug and play which would make it more commercially appealing. Condition settings could also be manipulated by enthusiasts to achieve a better outcome or grow a larger variety of species. </p>
